## Summary

Expense line-item rows use their positional array index as identity. Because the index
shifts on insert/remove, the code carries a reindex/remount apparatus (`reindexAfterRemoval`,
`reindexSet`, `onRowRemoved`, the `fileInputKey` remount) to keep out-of-form state (file map,
generation markers) aligned to moving rows. Give each row a stable client-side `id` at
creation, key that state by id, and retire the machinery — converting id→position only at the
submit boundary, where the positional `resolveInvoiceMediaIds` contract is load-bearing.

Rows are ephemeral form state — no persistence, schema migration, or backfill.
