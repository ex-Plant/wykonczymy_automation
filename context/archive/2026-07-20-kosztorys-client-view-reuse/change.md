## Notes

Replace the bespoke client share render with a read-only reuse of the admin `KosztorysEditorBody`. The client view IS the admin view minus a small omit-set, driven by a page-declared `clientView` boolean (the `/k/[token]` route and the owner preview both know they are client-facing) — no cookie read at render.

Omit-set:

- Grid columns: `priceMode`, `priceCoeff`, `note`, `actions`
- Footer: recon mismatch scream (`ReconMismatchBadge`)
- Internal links (materiały category, wpłaty) render as plain text, not `<Link>`

Data-leak posture (owner decision, 2026-07-20): the field-by-field `toClientView` projection is **retired**, not preserved. The owner accepted that the client payload may carry the full tree (subcontractor coeffs included); the view is safe _enough_ by rendering `view:'client'` + `readOnly` + hidden chrome, not by stripping the payload.

Tear out: `ClientKosztorysView`, `ClientKosztorysFooter`, `toClientView`/`toGridRows` + their types. `MoneyAxisToggle` is **kept** — reused for the slim client header.

`section-pie` is its **own separate slice** — remove it from the client view here, but do NOT delete/forget the component; it may be reintroduced on its own. Treat its removal as "not part of this reuse", not "gone for good".

Supersedes the S-13 / EX-532 bespoke build.

## Owner-visible deviations, ratified at the review gate (2026-07-20)

The plan promised "owner editor unchanged"; it isn't, and the owner ratified each change as
intended. Exhaustive list, so nobody later "fixes" one back:

- The verbose column labels („Pomiar (razem etapy)", „Razem Netto", „…względem
  przedmiaru/pomiaru"), the taller wrapping header row and the rewritten header tips are ungated —
  they apply to the owner grid too. Kept because they disambiguate „względem przedmiaru" vs
  „względem pomiaru".
- Post-merge (`baee9b68`): the money-axis toggle label „Oba" → „Pokaż wszystko" (the toggle renders
  in both the client slim header and the owner toolbar), and „Wyłącz link" now opens a
  `ConfirmDialog` — revoking a client's live link was previously a one-click destructive delete.
- The owner preview moved to `/podglad-klienta/[id]` under the `(share)` group so it renders under
  the same bare shell as the public link (byte-identical preview). It is **not** an IDOR: auth is an
  in-page `requireInvestmentOr404` plus a query-level `requireAuth` re-check — route-group
  membership was never the auth boundary here.
