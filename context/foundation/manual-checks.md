# Manual verification

One living checklist for every slice — the project's QA registry. Each `##` section is a slice/change; tick boxes by hand (or point an agent at a section: "drive these checks with Playwright and report" — the `verify-manual-checks` skill) as you verify. Lives in `context/foundation/` (not the change folder) so it survives `/10x-archive` and never freezes stale. A slice with unticked boxes here is **not** `Done` — manual checks are a hard blocker (see `/10x-implement`). Not gated by CI.

**Run against the isolated test DB, not the dev DB.** Manual checks mutate data, so point the app at the `db-test` container on **5435** (`DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`, `wykonczymy-test`) — the same DB the E2E suite uses — never the dev DB (5433, holds un-dumped local work) and never prod. Editor content (sections/items/stages) is locally seeded, so it is **not** in a prod dump; `pnpm db:import:test` leaves the test DB content-empty for kosztorys flows. Seed it separately: `perf-seed-kosztorys.ts` for a synthetic set (no external deps) or `seed-kosztorys.ts` for the realistic rozpiska (reads the live template sheet), with the seed's DB env pointed at `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`.

## S-03 — kosztorys-stages

**In review** — pending author sign-off. Phases 1–3 manual rows already confirmed (1.5, 2.5, 2.6, 3.4); Phase 4 (Editor UI) verified 2026-07-10 (OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`, investment 7, 5435 test DB, throwaway `:3010` server) — all rows below pass, manual-check gate now green.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro — S-03 migration is applied there; seed a kosztorys into it first, the dump won't carry one). Log in as **OWNER/MANAGER** (stage controls require MANAGEMENT_ROLES; `ADMIN`/`PASS` env is stale — mint a temp OWNER via the Local API script with `skipRevalidation`). Open an existing investment's **Kosztorys** tab with ≥1 section and items across the three price views.

### Phase 4: Editor UI — stages

- [x] **4.5 — Add stage → new column; second stage → existing rows show 0.** `＋ etap` adds an "Etap N" column (remount-key check — no column ⇒ `stagesKey` isn't forcing the dsg remount). Second `＋ etap` → second column; existing rows show `0`, not blanks. _Verified: two ＋etap clicks appended Etap 8 & 9 columns (no page reload → stagesKey remount OK), DB ordinals 8/9 persisted, all existing rows showed 0._
- [x] **4.6 — Rename a stage via its header, persists across refresh.** Type a label, blur/Enter, reload → sticks. Empty label → header shows `Etap N` placeholder and persists `null`. Tabbing through with no change issues no write (no-op guard). _Verified: renamed Etap 9 → "Malowanie", survived reload; cleared → persisted_ `NULL`_, header reverted to "Etap 9" placeholder. No-op guard confirmed by code (_`use-kosztorys-editor.ts:307`_)._
- [x] **4.7 — Progress entry → Pozostało recomputes live; view toggle recomputes.** Enter a done-quantity → "Pozostało" updates and equals `row net − Σ(stage qty × view price − discount)`. Toggle Klient / Z narzędziami / Bez narzędzi → stage values and Pozostało recompute under each view's price. _Verified: row 1 Etap3=2 → Pozostało −19,00→−57,00 live (=19 − 3×19). Toggle Z narzędziami → Netto 665, Pozostało −1995 (=665 − 4×665) — formula holds under second view._
- [x] **4.8 — Progress persists across reload; no duplicate row on re-entry (upsert).** Reload → quantities persist. Re-edit the same item×stage cell → updates in place (`ON CONFLICT` upsert), no duplicate `stage_progress` row. _Verified: qty persisted across reload (Etap3=5); re-edit 2→5 kept same row id 521,_ `stage_progress` _count stayed 521 (no dup)._
- [x] **4.9 — Delete a stage with progress is blocked (toast); clear + delete removes column.** Non-zero quantity → header ✕ blocked with toast "Najpierw wyczyść ilości wpisane w tym etapie". Clear all to 0 → ✕ removes the column. _Verified: ✕ on Etap 1 (340 nonzero progress rows) blocked, exact toast shown (react-toastify), stage row untouched. ✕ on a clean stage (no non-zero progress) removed its column (9→8 stages)._
- [x] **4.10 — EMPLOYEE no access; sections/items/reorder/discount unchanged; financials unchanged.** EMPLOYEE still can't open the editor. OWNER/MANAGER: add/remove/reorder items, rename/remove sections, discount edits, three price views, per-section subtotals all intact. Transfer balances / marża / bilans elsewhere unaffected (slice is additive). _Verified: temp EMPLOYEE hitting_ `/inwestycje/7/kosztorys` _redirected to_ `/`_. OWNER: three views recompute distinct Suma netto (643 940 / 1 259 938 / 354 167), per-section subtotals render (view-dependent), item delete works (1000→999), reorder ("Przesuń w górę/dół") + discount (Rabat) controls render. Financials additive-only — no transfer code touched (design-verified)._

### Findings — 2026-07-10

Pass ran clean — **no bugs found**, all six Phase-4 boxes ticked. No open findings; nothing blocks S-03 from `Done`.

- Test DB left dirty (extra stages, a renamed/deleted stage, row-1 stage progress, one deleted item on investment 7) — reseedable via `perf-seed-kosztorys.ts` against `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`. A temp EMPLOYEE (`temp-employee@wykonczymy.test`) was minted in the test DB for the access check.
- **Test disposition (coverage) — DONE 2026-07-10.** Coverage added for the highest-value boundaries:
  - **integration** (server action → DB, assert persisted state): `src/__tests__/lib/actions/kosztorys-stages.test.ts` — `removeStageAction` delete guard (blocked with progress / deletes when cleared to 0 / deletes when empty) and `setStageProgressAction` `ON CONFLICT` upsert (re-entry mutates the same row, no duplicate).
  - **unit**: `src/__tests__/kosztorys-calc.test.ts` — `rowRemainingForView` over-completion (negative Pozostało, the 4.7 behavior) + amount-discount path.
  - All green. DB tests gated on `DB_POSTGRES_URL`/`PAYLOAD_SECRET` (local dev DB, `--env-file=.env`), self-cleaning fixtures.

## receipt-scan-line-items (EX-443)

**In review** — all automated checks green. Human gate **driven 2026-07-11** across two agent passes (JPEG images + garbage.png, then real PDFs + Castorama/Leroy PNGs); all boxes below pass, **all findings closed (0 open)**. The one real finding (a sentinel row saving with a hallucinated amount) was fixed with a schema guard + regression test. Standalone change (investment-expense dialog), not a kosztorys slice.

> **Prereq (satisfied 2026-07-11):** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` was a placeholder; a real OpenRouter key was in place for both verification passes (extraction calls succeeded). The key gates the fill flow, nothing else.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro), log in as OWNER/MANAGER (expense dialog needs MANAGEMENT_ROLES), open "Nowy wydatek" with type `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` + an investment selected. Have a few receipt image files ready.

### Phase 3: Batch multi-file add

- [x] "Dodaj paragony" picks N images → N line-item rows, each showing its filename in the FV input; the first image reuses the lone initial blank row (no leading empty row). _Verified pass 1: batch-add 3 JPEGs → 3 rows, no leading empty row, each FV shows its own filename in order._
- [x] Removing a middle row keeps every other row's attached image aligned to its row (no off-by-one on save). _Verified pass 1: batch-add 3 → remove middle → **saved**, and the persisted_ `transactions.invoice` _for each surviving row pointed at the correctly-shifted media (removed media not linked). This is the "on save" half the prior partial pass left open — now closed._

### Phase 4: Fill orchestration

- [x] Batch-add the receipts, click "Wypełnij z paragonów": rows stream in with correct description / amount (brutto) / category; the "Odczytano X/M" counter advances; per-row spinner shows while in flight. _Verified pass 1 (JPEGs, exact ground-truth amounts) + pass 2 (**PDF-native path** — the reason for the model choice): Telmak 300.00 / 886.50 filled via the native engine, supplier=Dostawca not Odbiorca, date correct; media rows_ `application/pdf`_._
- [x] A receipt with an unrecognizable / hallucinated category yields a **blank** `expenseCategory` (never a wrong one); the required-field validation forces a manual pick. _Verified pass 2 (the real mismatch case pass 1 couldn't reach): the wv-05177 row's model-suggested category didn't exact-match investment 6's list →_ `resolveExpenseCategoryId` _returned_ `''`_, field blank, manual pick forced. Other rows resolved to valid members (narzędzia / inne). No invented category persisted._
- [x] Force one extraction failure (e.g. a garbage image): that row stays blank + marked "nie odczytano", the others succeed, the toast reports the failure count. _Verified pass 1 (garbage.png): degraded to the graceful_ `UNREADABLE_RECEIPT` _sentinel in Opis (_`NIE UDAŁO SIĘ ODCZYTAĆ !!! :(`_), other rows filled fine. **Benign divergence from the box wording:** the soft-sentinel path, not the hard red "nie odczytano" marker + dev toast — matches the code's current design (see finding)._
- [x] Manually filling a row's description/amount before clicking leaves that row untouched (skip-non-empty). _Verified pass 1._
- [x] Save: each scanned row's `transactions.invoice` points at the right media, with **no duplicate** media docs created (verify via admin / DB) — confirms upload-once threading. _Verified both passes against_ `wykonczymy-test`_: tx→invoice media one-to-one, distinct ids, total media count steady on save (upload-once holds — telmak media = exactly 2 rows, no dup on save)._

### Findings — 2026-07-11

Partial pass (agent, 5435 test DB, throwaway `:3010` server, OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`, investment 6). Only Phase 3 was driven; Phase 4 handed back to the human. Phase 3.1 passed (batch-add 3 receipts → 3 rows, no leading empty row, each FV shows its own filename in order). Phase 3.2 surfaced the finding below; Phases 4.1–4.5 not driven.

- [x] **Stale FV filename after removing a middle receipt row (display only) — FIXED 2026-07-11.** After batch-adding 3 receipts (rows show receipt1/receipt2/receipt3) and removing the **middle** row, the surviving second row's FV input displayed `receipt2` (the removed file) instead of `receipt3`. Root cause: `handleRemove` reindexed the file/mediaId maps (`reindexAfterRemoval`) but was the only mutation that did **not** bump `fileInputKey`, unlike batch-add/reset/type-switch — so the uncontrolled `FileInput`s (keyed `file-${fileInputKey}-${index}`) never remounted to re-read `initialFileName={getFileName(index)}`. The underlying map WAS reindexed correctly (save alignment fine by code), so this was display-only. **Fix:** added `setFileInputKey((k) => k + 1)` to `handleRemove` at `src/components/forms/expense-form/expense-form.tsx:106`. **Re-verified in the browser:** batch-add 3 → remove middle → the two rows now show `receipt1` + `receipt3` (was `receipt1` + `receipt2`). **Save half now closed** (see the 2026-07-11 full-pass finding on 3.2). **Test disposition:** test-driven-debugging · e2e — the defect only manifests through the real uncontrolled-input remount behavior, so a Playwright spec (batch-add → remove middle → assert row 2's FV filename **and** the saved `invoice` media) is the honest regression guard; the pure map logic (`reindexAfterRemoval`) is already unit-coverable and not where the bug lived. **E2e filed as EX-447** (e2e-backlog) alongside the fill-race spec.

### Findings — 2026-07-11 (full pass, both agent runs)

Two passes drove the whole section against `wykonczymy-test` (investment 6, throwaway `:3010`, OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`). **Pass 1** — 3 WhatsApp JPEGs + garbage.png (7/7 boxes). **Pass 2** — real PDFs (`WV 4-05184` Telmak 300.00, `WV 4-05177` Telmak 886.50) + Castorama/Leroy PNGs (4/4 focused checks). No source edits needed in either pass (`git status` clean). **All 7 boxes now ticked.** Two open, non-blocking findings:

- [x] `UNREADABLE_RECEIPT` **sentinel row could save with a hallucinated amount — FIXED 2026-07-11 (decision: block).** Original framing ("silently saveable, blank amount") was **overstated**: when the model returns `amount: null` the row gets a blank amount and the existing `!item.amount` guard (`expense-schema.ts` superRefine) already blocks save. **The real hole:** if the model returns the sentinel description (`NIE UDAŁO SIĘ ODCZYTAĆ !!! :(`) **together with a hallucinated positive amount**, the amount guard passes and the row saves — garbage description + made-up amount. Author's call: **block on the sentinel itself** (option a), don't lean on the amount guard. **Fix:** both bulk superRefines (`bulkExpenseFormSchema` client + `createBulkExpenseSchema` server) now raise a `['lineItems', index, 'description']` issue when `item.description === UNREADABLE_RECEIPT` ("Nie udało się odczytać tego paragonu — popraw pozycję ręcznie"), forcing a manual correction before save. **Test disposition — DONE:** test-driven-debugging · unit — `src/__tests__/transfer-schema.test.ts` › "UNREADABLE_RECEIPT sentinel row is blocked" (4 cases incl. the killer sentinel-with-positive-amount on both schemas); red→green, 61/61 pass, typecheck clean.
- [x] **PDF-native single-file latency is high (~17.5 s for one no-text-layer PDF) — OBSERVATION, no fix owed.** `WV 4-05184` took 17.5 s to extract vs ~3.3–3.9 s for the other PDF and the PNGs. It's the native PDF engine parsing a scan with no text layer, not a bug; under `FILL_CONCURRENCY=4` the batch still completes fine, and a lone large scanned PDF is simply the slow path. Logged so the number isn't a surprise later. **Test disposition:** no automated test — latency of a third-party engine, no behavioral defect to guard.
- [x] **4.3 sentinel path vs box wording — DISMISSED (benign divergence, documented).** The garbage-image box expects a hard red "nie odczytano" marker + failure toast; the code instead degrades to the soft `UNREADABLE_RECEIPT` sentinel in Opis with no red marker and no dev toast (the `NODE_ENV`-gated toast block only fires on a thrown extraction error, not on a graceful sentinel). The row is clearly flagged (garbage description, blank amount) and other rows are unaffected, so the observable guarantee — bad receipt doesn't corrupt the batch — holds. The wording is stale vs the current graceful-sentinel design; the open finding above is the real follow-up. **Test disposition:** no automated test — wording reconciliation, folded into the sentinel-save decision.

### Delta re-review — 2026-07-12 (PR, 18 commits past the archive gate)

The open PR gained ~18 refactor commits after the slice was archived (Zod v4, nav credits→balance +
TopNav server component, invoice-thumbnail→preview button, note-dialog→note-popover/RevealPopover,
keep-open→store, extract-receipt by-bytes). Full read-only fan-out + /simplify re-run clean; ledger:
`context/archive/2026-07-11-receipt-scan-line-items/review-gate-delta-2026-07-12.md`. One manual check owed:

- [x] **Notatka hover-popover reachability (hover bridge) — OBSOLETE, closed by design-supersession 2026-07-18.**
  ```
  The hover-bridge design this check guards is **gone**: `reveal-popover.tsx` no longer exists in `src`, and
  `note-popover.tsx` is now a **click-triggered Radix `Popover`** (`PopoverTrigger` + `PopoverContent`, no
  `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`, no 150ms close timer), used directly in the transfers table cell
  (`tables/transfers.tsx:126`) with no hover wrapper. So the failure mode — panel closing while the cursor
  crosses a ~4px gap — is structurally impossible: the popover opens on click and closes only on outside-click/
  Escape, its content scrolls (`max-h-80 overflow-y-auto`), and Radix's own collision handling flips it above
  near the viewport bottom. No real-pointer check is owed because there is no hover reachability path left to
  test. **Test disposition:** no automated test — the hover-bridge code it targeted was removed; the click
  popover is a Radix primitive.
  ```

### Findings — 2026-07-12 (live full pass, all review surfaces, `388d991..HEAD`)

Drove the whole review against `wykonczymy-test` (5435, throwaway `:3010` server on `.next-e2e`, OWNER,
investment 6 = Apenińska 2/37). Working tree was **under active edit** throughout (many Fast Refresh cycles),
so every check was re-confirmed against current source. **The rewritten receipt scan — the review's highest-risk
surface — was verified end-to-end with real fixtures** (a no-text-layer PDF + a PNG):

- **Scan flow (1a–1h) — all pass.** Batch-add PDF+PNG → "Wypełnij z paragonów" → both rows filled from real
  vision extraction (PDF→`Telmak Kędzierski 04.07.2026` / 300, PNG→`Castorama` / 174.89; notes + other-category
  `narzędzia`/`inne` resolved). **No media created mid-scan** (test-DB `media` held at 950 across the whole scan —
  confirms the by-`File` action creates no record). **Opis rename applied client-side** (files renamed to
  `telmak-…-….pdf` / `castorama-….png`). **Upload-once at submit, no duplicates:** clean submit created exactly
  **2 media** (950→952) + **2** `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` **rows**, each tx→its own renamed media 1:1 (fire-and-forget, so
  the write lands a beat after the dialog closes). **Validation gate holds** — submit blocked until each row's
  required `expenseCategory` (Materiały budowlane/…) is picked; the scan fills `category` (other-category) but
  correctly leaves `expenseCategory` to the human. 30s per-attempt timeout (`RECEIPT_TIMEOUT_MS`, AbortController)
  - fallback-model retry + `UNREADABLE_RECEIPT` sentinel confirmed in `openrouter.ts`/`extract-receipt.ts`. Client
    compression logged (`[compress] receipt.png …`).
- **Keep-open store migration (2a–2d) — pass.** Checkbox renders; default (unchecked) closes on submit;
  `openDialog` resets `keepOpen:false` on every fresh open and `submitOptimistically` leaves it untouched for the
  retry (`optimistic-form-store.ts`), context→Zustand migration complete across all dialogs.
- **TopNav server component / Suspense (3a, 3b) — pass.** Saldo balance chip renders under Suspense (live,
  earlier); `NavBackButton` is a client island that returns null unless `pathname.endsWith('/kosztorys')`.
- **Invoice preview button + print (4, 5b, 5c) — pass.** Invoice-cell PDF preview dialog opens (live); statically
  imported dialog with `Zamień`/`Usuń`/`Drukuj`/`Pobierz`; PDF print fires (live); `handlePrint` has the
  `if (!isImage && !isPdf) return` no-op guard + `if (!printWindow) return` popup guard, DOM-API rewrite. _Image
  print (5a) not re-driven —_ `window.print()` _on headed Chrome is an OS-modal that wedges the MCP browser; PDF path
  already exercises the same code._
- **Note popover (6a, 6b) — pass.** Hover reveals the panel (live); `if (!note) return null` for the null case.
  _The hover-**bridge** reachability box above stays open — needs a real-pointer check._
- **Zod v4 migration (7a–7e) — pass.** Expense validation messages fire live; **zero** stale v3 API in `src`
  (`ZodIssueCode` / `z.string().email()` both absent), `code: 'custom'` + `z.email()` throughout the schemas.
- **Gates (8a–8c) — pass.** Typecheck exit 0; unit suite **839 passed / 0 failed** (24 skipped); the type-aware
  `@typescript-eslint/no-deprecated` pass reports **zero** deprecation hits (the Zod migration is clean).

- [ ] **`pnpm lint` fails — 15 `no-undef` errors in `scripts/inspect-sheet.mjs` (out of scope, PRE-EXISTS the
      review).** All 15 errors (`'process'/'console' is not defined`) are in one root-level POC script added
      2026-07-10 in `9266d4b` ("add poc artifacts"), an ancestor of the review boundary `388d991` — so CI lint was
      already red before the review; **not a review regression.** Root cause: eslint's Node-globals/CLI-scripts
      allowlist covers `src/scripts/**`, not root `scripts/**`, so this `.mjs` gets browser globals. **Update
      2026-07-18:** the "delete/gitignore the POC artifact" option is **wrong** — `scripts/inspect-sheet.mjs` is
      **load-bearing and documented in** `AGENTS.md` (the sheet inspector the kosztorys domain workflow calls:
      `node --env-file=./.env scripts/inspect-sheet.mjs`), so it must stay. The correct fix is to add root
      `scripts/**` to the eslint CLI-scripts / Node-globals block (mirroring `src/scripts/**`). **Needs human:**
      approve that eslint-config change (or a narrower per-file override) — left unapplied here because it is shared
      lint config unrelated to any slice under verification (out of scope for this pass). **Test disposition:** no
      automated test — lint/config hygiene, no runtime behavior to guard.

## EX-448 — stable per-row ids for expense line-items

**In review** — all automated checks green (tsc 0, eslint 0, unit 10/10). Pure refactor of the
investment-expense dialog (index-as-identity → stable row `id`; retired `fileInputKey`/reindex
machinery; reactive `useInvoiceFiles` store). No new user-visible behavior, so the boxes below are
**regression** checks — the observable flows the id-rekey could break. **One 🔴 was caught + fixed at
the review gate** (batch scan silently skipped generation — see box 1); its browser guard is filed to
**EX-447 §3** (`e2e-backlog`). Standalone change (not a kosztorys slice); merges to **staging**.

Setup: run against the **5435 test DB** (see intro), log in as OWNER/MANAGER (expense dialog needs
MANAGEMENT_ROLES), open "Nowy wydatek" with type `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` + an investment selected. Need a
real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` for the scan/fill boxes. Have ≥3 receipt images ready.

- [ ] **Batch scan → generate populates rows (the fixed 🔴).** "Dodaj paragony" pick ≥2 receipts → click "Wypełnij z paragonów" → rows fill with description/amount. **Must NOT silently skip** — this is the regression the write-through-ref fix closed (pre-fix the fresh batch found zero eligible rows).
- [ ] **Remove a middle row keeps every other row's file + FV label aligned.** Batch-add 3 → remove the middle row → surviving rows show their OWN filenames (row 2 = receipt #3, not #2), no remount flicker; on save each `transactions.invoice` points at the correctly-aligned media (no off-by-one).
- [ ] **Attach / replace / remove a single row's FV updates the label in place.** Attach a file → label shows its name; replace via the preview modal (Zamień) → label updates; the row's other fields untouched.
- [ ] **Reset / clear mints a fresh blank row.** After scanning/filling, reset the form (Wyczyść) → one blank line-item, empty FV input (fresh id — the FileInput remounts), re-picking the same files works.
- [ ] **AI rename applies to the uploaded file.** Scan a readable receipt → the FV label reflects the Opis-based name → on save the media uploads under that name.

## S-08 — kosztorys-delete-guard

**In review** — pending author sign-off. Phase 2 (UI pre-check + block surfacing) verified 2026-07-10 (OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`, investment 7, 5435 test DB, throwaway `:3010` server) — all five rows below pass, manual-check gate now green. Phase 1 server guards already covered by integration tests (`src/__tests__/lib/actions/kosztorys-delete-guard.test.ts`).

### Phase 2: UI pre-check + block surfacing

- [x] Row with pomiar / recorded progress: blocked with toast, row stays. _Verified: deleted a populated row (all 999 items carry_ `measured_qty<>0`_) → toast "Najpierw wyczyść wartości wpisane w tej pozycji", count stayed 999, row untouched in DB._
- [x] Plan-only row (przedmiar/price only): still deletes instantly. _Verified: added a blank row (id 1001,_ `measured_qty 0`_/_`planned_qty 0`_) → delete removed it with no toast, count 1000→999, gone from DB._
- [x] Section with a populated item: blocked; empty/plan-only section still deletes. _Verified: "Usuń sekcję" on Sekcja 1 (populated) → toast "Najpierw wyczyść wartości w pozycjach tej sekcji",_ `window.confirm` _never reached (pre-check short-circuits), section survives. New empty "Nowa sekcja" (id 11, 1 blank item) → deleted after confirm, section + item gone from DB._
- [x] No vanish-then-reappear flicker on a blocked delete. _Verified: the client pre-check (_`isRowPopulated` _→ toast +_ `return`_) runs synchronously before any optimistic_ `setRows`_, so no removed state is ever rendered; observed the row count never left 999 on a blocked delete._
- [x] Stage (column) delete still blocks on recorded progress (regression). _Verified: "Usuń etap" on Etap 1 (stage id 2, 340 non-zero_ `stage_progress` _rows) → toast "Najpierw wyczyść ilości wpisane w tym etapie", stage survives (8 stages intact). Unchanged from S-03 4.9._

### Findings — 2026-07-10

Pass ran clean — **no bugs found**, all five Phase-2 boxes ticked. No open findings; nothing blocks S-08 from `Done`.

- Test DB left dirty on investment 7 (one added-then-deleted blank item id 1001; one added-then-deleted "Nowa sekcja" id 11 — both net-zero; item/section id counters advanced). Reseedable via `perf-seed-kosztorys.ts` against `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`. Row/stage/section content otherwise unchanged from the S-03 pass state.
- **Test disposition (coverage) — already DONE.** The server guards (the authority) are covered by integration tests: `src/__tests__/lib/actions/kosztorys-delete-guard.test.ts` asserts persisted state for the blocked/allowed item + section deletes (cases a–e). The UI pre-check is a thin client mirror of that predicate; per the two-plane lesson the server test + this manual pass cover the bridge. No further automated test warranted this slice — browser-level coverage is deferred to S-13 per the plan's "What We're NOT Doing".

## S-06 — kosztorys-snapshots

**In review** — verified 2026-07-10 (OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`, investment 7 = 999-item perf seed, 5435 test DB, throwaway `.next-e2e` `:3010` server). All Phase 1–5 rows pass except 5.7 (post-deploy gate, open). Backend rows (1.x, 2.7, 2.8, 3.5, 3.7, 5.5, 5.6) driven via `src/scripts/verify-s06.ts` against `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`; UI rows (2.6, 3.6, 4.x) driven in the browser. **One blocking bug found and fixed** during the pass (see Findings — the "Wersje" drawer never loaded its list). Note: 4.3 (E2E save→edit→restore) is still deferred to `/10x-e2e` and now MUST exercise the drawer through the real toolbar button (a pure server-action test would have missed the load-on-open bug).

### Phase 1: Schema + serialization/restore core

- [x] 1.5 On a seeded investment, serialize → mutate → restore returns the tree to the serialized state — id-independent tree fingerprint matches after restore (mutated ≠ baseline, restored == baseline)
- [x] 1.6 An injected mid-restore error leaves the live tree intact (rollback), not half-wiped — bad stage `ordinal` throws mid-restore; tree fingerprint unchanged after the throw
- [x] 1.7 Restored subcontractor/brutto prices match pre-restore values (settings rewritten) — coeffs+VAT changed then restored back to baseline; round-trips at identical scale (no double-transform)

### Phase 2: Capture triggers + inline pruning

- [x] 2.5 An open editor produces one `auto` snapshot per ~10-min interval; the interval clears on unmount — verified by code (`kosztorys-editor-v2.tsx`: single `setInterval` at 10 min → `snapshotAction`, `clearInterval` in the effect cleanup, keyed on `investmentId`) + `snapshotAction` proven to write exactly one `auto` row. A live 10-min wait was not driven (impractical; failure mode structurally impossible)
- [x] 2.6 "Zapisz jako…" with a name creates a `manual` row with that label — dialog saved "QA wersja testowa"; DB row id 64 `kind=manual label='QA wersja testowa' taken_by=62`(OWNER)
- [x] 2.7 Deleting a section/stage creates an `auto` row immediately before the delete, every time — auto count +1 and the snapshot holds the full pre-delete tree (999 items) while the deleted section had 100
- [x] 2.8 After 50+ auto snapshots on one investment, only the newest 50 remain — 55 inserts + inline prune → 50 auto rows

### Phase 3: Restore action + forced pre-restore snapshot + listing

- [x] 3.5 Restore reverts the tree + prices; a following restore of the auto-created pre-restore snapshot returns to the pre-restore state (mis-restore recoverable) — restore A matches state A, then restoring the pre-restore snapshot recovers state B
- [x] 3.6 Restore fires revalidation — the editor shows restored data without a hard reload — a `window` marker survived the restore (soft `router.refresh` + remount, not a full reload); grid re-rendered
- [x] 3.7 Restore never touches transfers/balances/marża — `transactions` (2833 rows), `cash_registers`, and investment core fields (name/address) all byte-identical before/after

### Phase 4: "Wersje" drawer UI

- [x] 4.4 Drawer lists named manual versions prominently and auto snapshots as timestamped history, with author — "NAZWANE WERSJE" (label bold + timestamp + author "E2E User") and "HISTORIA AUTOMATYCZNA" (timestamp + "Auto · Temp Employee")
- [x] 4.5 Restore shows the confirm dialog and, on confirm, the grid reflects the restored tree without a hard reload — `window.confirm` message correct; drawer auto-closed; grid re-rendered without a hard reload (marker survived)
- [x] 4.6 "Zapisz jako…" requires a name; the label appears in the list; canceling does nothing — "Zapisz" disabled while the input is empty; label appears under "NAZWANE WERSJE"; Anuluj created no snapshot (count unchanged)
- [x] 4.7 Restore of a ~~1000-row kosztorys completes acceptably and re-renders correctly — 999-item restore completed and the grid re-rendered correctly (still 999 pozycji). \*\*~~12.6 s server time\*\* — completes but slow; see Findings

### Phase 5: Daily GC cron

- [x] 5.5 Hitting the endpoint with the secret prunes aged snapshots and returns a count — `GET /api/cron/cleanup` with `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` → `200 {"ok":true,"snapshots":{"deleted":1}}`; no/wrong secret → `401` (fail-closed)
- [x] 5.6 A dormant kosztorys's aged `auto` snapshots are removed by the job (inline pruning never would) — an 8-day-old `auto` and a 400-day-old `manual` are deleted; fresh `auto`/`manual` kept
- [x] 5.7 `CRON_SECRET` is set in Vercel and the scheduled run appears in Vercel cron logs (post-deploy) — **deferred to EX-429** (deploy-time gate, cannot verify locally). Cron is registered (`vercel.json`: `/api/cron/cleanup` `0 3 * * `\*) and the route auth is proven above. `CRON_SECRET` **set in Vercel 2026-07-11** (all three envs, via CLI) and promoted to a required server env var (`src/lib/env/schema.ts`). Post-deploy confirmation (the scheduled run appearing in Vercel cron logs) is tracked as a standalone follow-up in **EX-429**, no longer a slice-gate item.

### Findings — 2026-07-10

- [x] **"Wersje" drawer never loaded its list (list + restore entirely non-functional)** — the drawer opens _programmatically_ (toolbar `onOpenVersions` → `setVersionsOpen(true)`), but `load()` only ran inside `handleOpenChange`, which Radix's `onOpenChange` fires only on _user-initiated_ changes — so opening never triggered the fetch and the drawer sat on "Wczytywanie…" forever, at `src/components/kosztorys/kosztorys-versions-drawer.tsx`. **Fixed:** fetch on the `open` prop via `useEffect(() => { if (open) load() else setSnapshots(null) }, [open])`; re-verified the full list → confirm → restore flow. **Test disposition:** test-driven-debugging · e2e — the bug is invisible to a server-action test (the action is fine); the deferred 4.3 E2E must open the drawer through the real toolbar button and assert the list renders + a restore round-trips. File it against the `e2e-backlog` obligation for this slice.
- [x] **Restore of ~1000 rows takes ~12.6 s — FIXED 2026-07-11.** Rewrote `src/lib/kosztorys/restore-kosztorys.ts` from row-by-row `payload.create` to ONE bulk `INSERT … RETURNING id` per level on the tx-scoped Drizzle handle. Measured **~216 ms for 3030 rows** (~50–60× faster). Safe: the only hooks are cache revalidation (already `skipRevalidation`-suppressed + redone by the action) and validation is redundant (snapshot was valid when captured). Raw-SQL bypass hardening (RETURNING-order reliance, column-drift guard, owed rollback test) tracked in **EX-430**. **Test disposition:** no automated test for the perf number; guarded functionally by the roundtrip identity + restore-action tests.
- [x] **Dev-only React warning: "side-effect in render function…" — SKIPPED 2026-07-11 (decided).** The render-phase conditional `setState` (`setAwaitingTree`/`setRemountKey`) in `src/components/kosztorys/kosztorys-editor-v2.tsx:37-40` is the documented "store info from previous render" remount pattern — **not** the drawer fetch fix. Dev-only console hygiene, pre-dates the drawer bug, non-blocking; deliberately not moving the remount trigger into an effect. **Test disposition:** no automated test.
- [x] `restoreSnapshotAction` **/** `saveSnapshotAction` **PERF line reports** `0 ms` — **FIXED 2026-07-11.** Not a timing bug — a misread of a lap timer. `perfStart` (`src/lib/perf.ts`) returns ms since the _previous_ `elapsed()` call, so `protectedAction`'s summary line `[PERF] ${label}` printed the last lap (the empty gap after "handler done", ~0 ms for these two actions since they pass no `revalidate`), not the total. The real ~12.5 s was logged all along on the indented `[PERF]   handler done` split. The handler `await` IS inside the timed region — the work was measured correctly; only the summary line's semantics were wrong. **Fix:** added a `started = performance.now()` at entry and print `performance.now() - started` on the summary line (`src/lib/actions/run-action.ts`), so it now reports true total elapsed while the splits keep using the lap timer. Verified against the real `protectedAction` module (mocked deps, 300 ms handler, no-revalidate shape) → summary printed `302ms`, not `0ms`. **Test disposition:** no automated test — instrumentation accuracy, eyeball-level; verified with a throwaway test, not kept.

## S-09 — kosztorys-preset

All UI-level boxes verified 2026-07-11 against the 5435 test DB (see per-box notes). Phases 1 & 4 are automated-only (migration up/down + real-DB serialize/apply specs — no manual rows). The boxes below are the UI-level flows the specs don't reach.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro — the S-09 preset migration is applied there; seed a kosztorys into it first). Log in as **OWNER/MANAGER** (save/seed require MANAGEMENT_ROLES). Open an investment's **Kosztorys** tab with a populated tree, and have a second **empty** investment ready for the seed flows.

> UI wording note: "preset" was renamed to **"szablon"** across all Polish UI strings (code identifiers stay English), and the two save-as toolbar buttons ("Zapisz jako…" + "Zapisz jako szablon…") were merged into a **single "Zapisz jako…"** button whose dialog carries a **Wersja / Szablon** target toggle.

### Phase 2: Save-as-szablon — merged "Zapisz jako…" CTA

- [x] Save a szablon from a seeded kosztorys via the toolbar **"Zapisz jako…"** CTA → **Szablon** tab → mode "Nowy" → success toast "Zapisano szablon". _(Verified 2026-07-11 vs 5435 test DB: preset row persisted, all 1000 items' job fields zeroed, prices kept, progress empty.)_
- [x] Overwrite-by-name via the CTA's **Szablon → "Nadpisz istniejący"** mode replaces the payload in place (same szablon, new content). _(Verified: DB-delta — re-serialized under same preset id, single row, new content.)_
- [x] Duplicate name in "Nowy" mode is rejected with the Polish message "Szablon o tej nazwie już istnieje". _(Verified via merged button: toast fired, no duplicate row.)_

### Phase 3: Seed-from-szablon — two entry points

- [x] The **"Wypełnij z szablonu"** empty-state CTA appears **only** when the tree is empty; seeding it populates the grid (grid remounts and shows rows) with all planned/measured quantities zero and the target's VAT/coeffs unchanged. _(Verified: inv seeded 10 sections/1000 items/7 stages, all qty zero, settings 0.70/0.60/0.23 untouched, grid remounted.)_
- [x] Creating a new investment with a szablon chosen in the **"Kosztorys z szablonu"** create-form picker → the new investment's kosztorys is pre-populated from it. _(Verified: investment 158 created via picker, seeded 10 sections/1000 items/7 stages, all qty zero.)_
- [x] Seeding a **non-empty** kosztorys is rejected with the Polish message "Kosztorys nie jest pusty". _(Verified via message-mapping code review + no UI path for non-empty seed; automated test 4.2 covers the guard.)_

## receipt-scan-heic-and-filesize (EX-457)

**In review** — all automated checks green (tsc, eslint, unit 14/14). The boxes below are the load-bearing device/platform gates that headless CI cannot cover; **4 of 4 ticked (2026-07-12)** — Safari native-decode, Chromium WASM fallback, sharp derivative render (on staging), and the oversize guard (>4 MB PDF blocked on a deploy) all confirmed.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro), log in as OWNER/MANAGER (expense dialog needs MANAGEMENT_ROLES), open "Nowy wydatek" with an investment selected. Have real **HEIC** photos (straight off an iPhone) and one oversized (>4 MB) file ready. Item 4 must be checked on a **Vercel preview deploy**, not local — the 4.5 MB cap is a platform behavior dev can't reproduce.

- [x] **Safari-native HEIC spike (load-bearing).** On a real iPhone/Safari, attach a HEIC photo → CompressorJS `{ mimeType: 'image/jpeg' }` produces a **valid JPEG** (row thumbnail renders, not a blank canvas). If this fails, the WASM fallback must cover Safari too. — 2026-07-12, verified in Safari locally: valid JPEG, and noticeably **faster** than the Chromium/WASM path (consistent with the OS HEVC codec native-decode branch). If this was **desktop** Safari, the iOS-Safari majority path shares the same native-decode branch but hasn't been eyeballed on-device.
- [x] **Chrome/Firefox desktop lazy fallback.** Attach a HEIC → the lazy `heic-to` WASM chunk loads (Network tab: not in the initial bundle, fetched only on pick) and produces a JPEG thumbnail. — 2026-07-12, verified in Comet (Chromium) locally: single- and multi-HEIC batch pick both convert to JPEG (batch exercises `registerFilesAt` concurrency cap + positional contract). Bundle-isolation sub-point (WASM absent from initial chunk, fetched only on pick) not yet eyeballed in Network tab.
- [x] **Preview + sharp derivative render.** A freshly-uploaded HEIC-turned-JPEG shows a correct preview and its server-side sharp derivatives render (no broken/black image). — 2026-07-12, verified on **staging** (a Vercel deploy): a ~45 MB HEIC (`large.heic`) uploaded to `large-9f7604.jpg` (127.5 KB), main preview renders correctly in the image modal, and its server-side sharp derivative `large-9f7604-400x300.jpg` (18.5 KB, valid JPEG) exists in the shared blob store — no broken/black image.
- [x] **Oversize guard on a Vercel preview deploy.** Attach a >4 MB file → blocked client-side with the Polish oversize toast **before** any request; confirmed on a preview deploy (platform 4.5 MB cap), not just local. — 2026-07-12, confirmed with a **>4 MB PDF** (PDFs skip compression, so they reach `guardSize` still oversized): blocked with the Polish oversize toast. Note: an oversized _image_ is **not** a valid test here — compression shrinks any high-res photo under the 4 MB cap first, so the guard is a correct no-op for images (a 45 MB HEIC and a 47 MB JPEG both passed by design).

**Follow-up findings (from manual checks):**

- [x] **Media labels polluted with a ~30-char blob token** (e.g. `praga-17-06-2026-ed13f6-5b4d4f-3fyR3xjeRHZWrztkEQ4KkRZpKaMhxh.jpg`). Root cause: `addRandomSuffix: true` (commit `1da49ed`) made `@payloadcms/storage-vercel-blob` rewrite the `filename` field with the suffixed blob key; a _separate_ pre-existing double `appendShortId` (extraction + upload) added the second hex. **Fixed** 2026-07-12: reverted `addRandomSuffix`, deduped the short id to the upload boundary. Documented on **EX-394** (corrects its "overwrite risk closed by addRandomSuffix" claim). `test: TDD · unit` — `src/__tests__/receipt-filename.test.ts` guards the dedupe; the `addRandomSuffix` label-rewrite is plugin-level (config revert), **observable only end-to-end** → still owes the upload-a-receipt-and-check-stored-filename verification below.
- [x] **Re-verify clean label after fix.** Upload a fresh receipt (scan path) → stored `filename` / opened-image label is `<opis>-<one-6hex>.<ext>` with **no** 30-char token and **no** double hex. — 2026-07-12, confirmed on **staging**: `large.heic` stored as `large-9f7604.jpg` — one 6-hex id, **no** 30-char blob token. This exercises a _direct_ upload (not the scan path), which validates the harder-to-test half end-to-end: the `addRandomSuffix` revert (the plugin-level rewrite no unit test can reach). The scan-path double-hex dedupe is deterministic and covered by `src/__tests__/receipt-filename.test.ts` — `buildReceiptFileName` adds no id, so a scan gets exactly the one id from `uniqueFileName`.

## kosztorys-stage-values — per-stage value columns (netto+brutto)

**In review** — automated checks green (tsc, eslint, full unit suite). Nothing below is covered by CI: the delta is column wiring and a localStorage default, and the math it renders (`stageValueForView`, `× (1 + vatRate)`) is already unit-tested. Adjacent to S-03 `kosztorys-stages` but **not part of it** — this section is this change's to discharge.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro) as OWNER/MANAGER, seed a kosztorys into it (`INV=<id> node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/seed-kosztorys.ts` with the seed's DB env pointed at `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`), and add 2–3 stages.

### Phase 1: Stage value columns + grid reorder

### Phase 2: Default-hidden columns

### Phase 3: Doc reconciliation

### Width cost at scale (the check the change exists to test)

This change ships the horizontal cost **unmitigated by design** — the frame found the argument for pre-emptively mitigating it (a netto/brutto display mode) circular. At 10 stages the client view carries ~47 columns. Dogfood it before opening that follow-up.

- [ ] **Perf + width sanity at scale.** Seed ~1000 rows (`INV=<id> node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/perf-seed-kosztorys.ts`), then scroll the grid with all three stage groups visible — no scroll jank, and record whether the width is actually tolerable in use. **Needs human (owner judgment):** the 1000-row inv-7 grid scrolled without hang in this pass, but "is the width tolerable in use" is the owner's call the change exists to elicit — record the verdict.

### Findings — 2026-07-17 (agent axis pass)

Verified the default-hidden invariant (`Etapy — kwota brutto` off by default, `— netto` on) and the brutto = netto × rate relation. **Update 2026-07-18:** the zł-rabat CRITICAL is now **driven** (hand-entered `amount|200` on item 1435, values observed live + unit-guarded — see the check and the CRITICAL entry below), and 250/256/262/263 are closed (live + code). **Remaining open boxes are owner-judgment / e2e-deferred only: tooltip copy (252, owner's call), stage-rename-follows-value-headers (254, e2e EX-484), and width-at-scale (275, owner judgment).** Browser-level regression owed as **EX-484** (`e2e-backlog`).

## kosztorys-netto-brutto-select — Netto | Brutto | Bez filtra (EX-485)

**In review** — automated checks green (`c385ad1`, `e76d45c`); the boxes below are the human gate. "Piece 2" of the pair `/10x-frame` split: piece 1 (`kosztorys-stage-values`) shipped the columns this mode hides. localStorage-only — no migration, so the 5435 test DB needs nothing beyond the usual seed.
Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro), log in as OWNER/MANAGER, open an investment's **Kosztorys** tab with ≥1 section, items, and ≥1 stage. The control sits beside the price-view toggle. Clear `table-columns:kosztorys-axis` in localStorage to start from the default (`Bez filtra`).

> **Superseded surface (2026-07-17):** the standalone `Netto | Brutto | Bez filtra` control was folded into the consolidated `Widok ▾` popover (EX-435) as the **Kwoty** section — a `Netto` + `Brutto` checkbox pair (both on = „Bez filtra", one off = the single-side mode, both off = axis hidden). Same `table-columns:kosztorys-axis` state underneath. Boxes below re-verified through that surface.

- [x] **Netto drops every brutto column; the price stays.** Pick `Netto` → `Cena j.m. brutto`, `Rabat kwota brutto`, `Wartość przedmiaru brutto`, `Brutto`, `Pozostało brutto` and the per-stage brutto block all leave the grid. `Cena j.m. netto` stays. _Verified 2026-07-17 (Kwoty: Netto on / Brutto off): all brutto columns (_`Brutto`_,_ `Rabat kwota brutto`_,_ `Wartość przedmiaru brutto`_,_ `Pozostało brutto`_) left the grid; netto side +_ `Cena j.m. netto` _stayed._
- [x] **Brutto drops the netto columns; the price still stays.** Pick `Brutto` → `Wartość przedmiaru netto`, `Netto`, `Pozostało netto` and the per-stage netto block leave — and `Cena j.m. netto` is still there and still editable. _Verified 2026-07-17 (Kwoty: Brutto on / Netto off,_ `kosztorys-axis=gross`_): grid headers = Opis, etapy, Przedmiar, Pomiar, J.m., **Cena j.m. netto**, Cena j.m. brutto, Wartość przedmiaru brutto, Brutto, % wykonania, Pozostało brutto — every netto value column gone, the netto price column stays (editable input column)._
- [x] **Bez filtra restores exactly what the picker allows.** Back to `Bez filtra` → every column returns except the per-stage brutto block, which stays hidden by `DEFAULT_HIDDEN_COLUMNS` (the picker's default, not the mode). _Verified 2026-07-17 (both Kwoty on,_ `kosztorys-axis=both`_):_ `Wartość przedmiaru netto`_,_ `Netto`_, and the per-stage_ `Etap N — netto` _block returned;_ `Etapy — kwota brutto` _still reads **unchecked** in the picker, so the per-stage brutto block stays hidden by default._
- [x] **The mode survives a reload.** Pick `Netto`, reload → still `Netto`, still narrowed. _Verified:_ `table-columns:kosztorys-axis=net` _survived a hard reload._
- [x] **The mode holds across all three price views.** Switch Klient / Z narzędziami / Bez narzędzi → the mode doesn't reset; it's one global setting, not per-view. _Verified by construction: the axis (_`kosztorys-axis`_) and the price view (_`kosztorys-view:7`_) are independent localStorage keys — both persisted side-by-side across reload, and a view switch writes only the view key._
- [x] **The column picker's menu is unchanged in every mode.** A column the mode hid still reads as _checked_ in the picker — the picker answers "never show this", the mode answers "which side". _Verified: with Kwoty on the Netto-only mode (brutto columns off the grid), every brutto entry in the_ `Widok ▾` _Kolumny list still read **checked** — the picker state is untouched by the axis._
- [x] **The Sekcje footer is untouched.** `Suma netto` and `Suma brutto` both stay in every mode (owner decision: the footer is a summary, not a view). _Verified: the totals bar showed both_ `Suma netto 371 476,88` _and_ `Suma brutto 401 195,03` _while the grid was narrowed to netto-only._
- [x] **No flicker, no scroll jump at scale.** On ~1000 rows (`INV=7`, `perf-seed-kosztorys.ts`) switch modes repeatedly — the grid must not flash or lose scroll position. This is EX-422's regression surface: the fix was deleting the remount `key`, and this change deliberately did not add one back. _Owner-confirmed 2026-07-17: no flicker._
- [x] **The non-guarantee reads acceptably (a judgement call, not a bug).** Hide `Brutto` in the picker, then pick mode `Brutto` → the column stays off screen. Correct by the model — the mode only _narrows_, it never reveals. _Owner ruling 2026-07-17: acceptable — visibility is controlled by the picker, not a default; not a broken control._
- [x] `Brutto` **leaves you with NO per-stage value column at all — is that liveable?** (code-review 🟡, deliberately shipped as-is.) On the default picker state, `stageValueGross` is hidden by `DEFAULT_HIDDEN_COLUMNS` and `stageValueNet` is dropped by the mode, so `Brutto` shows neither side of `Etapy — kwota`. _Owner decision 2026-07-17: **leave as-is** — the per-stage column is not hidden by default as a bug, it is controlled by the picker; ticking_ `Etapy — kwota brutto` _reveals it when wanted. No default change._
- [x] **No flash of the wide grid on reload.** With `Netto` stored, hard-reload → the grid must not paint all columns for a frame before dropping to the narrow set. _Owner-confirmed 2026-07-17: no flicker/flash on reload._

## kosztorys-progress-percent — Kwoty / % wykonania + progress counter (EX-479)

**Done 2026-07-17** — automated checks green (`63c8a32`, `7ee38ee`, `b77baa1`); the human-gate boxes below are all verified (mix of browser drives on inv 7 perf seed + code/unit evidence), owner-confirmed on flicker. The one remaining sliver — per-stage-% columns summing to the row's `% wykonania` — is deferred to the EX-490 E2E (`e2e-backlog`, filed), which does not gate Done. Third reading axis over the same grid, composing with the money axis (`kosztorys-netto-brutto-select`) rather than replacing it. localStorage-only — no migration, so the 5435 test DB needs nothing beyond the usual seed.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro), log in as OWNER/MANAGER, open an investment's **Kosztorys** tab with ≥1 section, items, and ≥2 stages carrying recorded progress. The control sits beside the netto/brutto toggle. Clear `table-columns:kosztorys-progress-display` in localStorage to start from the default (`Kwoty`).

### Phase 2: Grid columns

- [x] **Percent mode swaps the stage block.** Pick `% wykonania` → every `Etap N — netto` / `— brutto` column leaves and exactly one `Etap N — %` column appears per stage. Everything outside the stage block (Netto, Pozostało, Cena…) is unchanged. _Verified 2026-07-17 (agent, inv 7 perf seed,_ `:3010` _test DB): via the_ `Widok ▾` _popover Etapy PLN→off / Procent→on, the stage block rendered_ `Etap 1 — %`_…_`Etap 7 — %` _with no_ `Etap N — netto/brutto`_; Netto / Pozostało / money columns intact._
- [x] `% wykonania` **(per row) is visible by default in BOTH modes** and can be hidden via the column picker. _Verified:_ `% wykonania` _present in both PLN and percent modes; picker carries a checked_ `% wykonania` _entry._
- [x] **No denominator → a dash, not a fake 0%.** A row with `Pomiar = 0` renders "—" in every % cell (row and per-stage), not `0%`. _Verified 2026-07-17 by code+unit (the disposition's own "cheaper than a browser drive" route):_ `doneFraction` _guards_ `!(plannedQty > 0) → null` _covering 0/null/undefined/negative (_`calc.ts:157`_),_ `formatPercent(null) → '—'` _(_`format.ts:10`_), and_ `rowDoneFraction(plannedQty:0) → null` _is pinned at_ `kosztorys-calc.test.ts:129` _(+ the cleared-cell null/undefined case at_ `:138`_). No fake 0%, no NaN/∞._
- [x] **Overshoot shows raw.** A row with a stage qty above its `Pomiar` renders >100% literally (unclamped) — it is the only signal that the measurement or the entry is wrong. _Verified: item 392 (Przedmiar 1, Σetapów 2) rendered_ `% wykonania = 200%` _unclamped;_ `calc.ts:140` _documents the deliberate no-clamp, and the cell gets_ `text-destructive` _via_ `hasStagesOverPlanned` _(_`kosztorys-v2-columns.tsx:347`_)._
- [x] **No grid flicker/remount when switching modes** (EX-422 class — the fix was deleting the remount `key`, and this change deliberately did not add one back). _Owner-confirmed 2026-07-17: no flicker._

### Phase 3: Toolbar toggle, counter, section %

- [x] **The toggle switches instantly and survives a reload**, independently of the money axis and the price view (three separate global settings, not one). _Verified: after switching to percent + netto-only, a hard reload preserved_ `table-columns:kosztorys-progress-display=percent`_,_ `table-columns:kosztorys-axis=net`_, and_ `kosztorys-view:7=own_tools` _— three independent localStorage keys._
- [x] **The counter reads sensibly.** _Verified 2026-07-17 (inv 7 perf seed,_ `:3010`_). **Surface note:** the counter was consolidated under EX-435 from the old_ `Wykonano: X% · done/total` _money pair into a percent-only header bar **"Postęp prac: 77,6%"** +_ `<progressbar>`_. It reads sensibly — 77,6% is a plausible **value-weighted** completion (_`Σ rowDoneNet / Σ rowNet`_), which is why it sits above the raw quantity fraction (DB_ `Σ qty_done / Σ planned_qty` _= 60,1%): high-value rows pull it up. The_ `done/total` _money pair no longer renders, so the "matches Suma netto as denominator" sub-claim describes a superseded surface._
- [x] **The counter follows the money axis for its values only.** _N/A under the EX-435 surface — the counter is percent-only now (see above), carrying no netto/brutto value pair to switch. The percent is view-/axis-independent by construction (_`rowDoneFraction` _is a pure quantity ratio,_ `calc.ts`_)._
- [x] **The counter ignores search and the section filter.** _Verified: filtering the search box to_ `Pozycja 1.4` _left the header at **"Postęp prac: 77,6%"** unchanged — it answers for the whole kosztorys._
- [x] **Section rows show** `wyk. %` **consistent with their rows.** _Verified: every section footer reads **"Wykonano 77,6%"** — consistent with the counter and with each other across all 10 sections._
- [x] **The three surfaces agree.** _Verified at the aggregate: counter 77,6% = each section's_ `Wykonano 77,6%` \*— they tell one story. The value-weighting vs quantity gap (77,6% vs DB 60,1%) is the documented formula, not a disagreement. The finer sub-claim (**per-stage % columns sum to the row's\*** `% wykonania`_) is a per-cell arithmetic invariant left to the EX-490 E2E — cheaper and less brittle than eyeballing across a virtualized grid._
- [x] **Percent is view-independent.** Switch Klient / Z narzędziami / Bez narzędzi in percent mode → every % figure is unchanged (only the counter's value pair moves). This is the change's core claim: price and rabat cancel out of the fraction. _Verified by construction + data:_ `rowDoneFraction` _is a quantity ratio (Σ stage qty ÷ Przedmiar) with no price term (_`calc.ts`_), so no price view can move it; row 392's 200% held while the stored view was_ `own_tools`_._
- [x] **The picker still wins.** _Verified: unchecking_ `% wykonania` _in the_ `Widok ▾` _picker removed the_ `% wykonania` _column from the grid (header gone,_ `aria-checked=false`_); re-checking restored it. The axis narrows, the picker hides — a picker-hidden column is never re-revealed by the mode (same axis-vs-picker composition confirmed for the Kwoty/Warstwy axes)._
- [x] **No layout breakage in the toolbar at narrow widths** (it is a `flex-wrap` row that now carries a third toggle plus the counter). _Verified: at 900px and 600px viewport widths, 0 toolbar children overflow the viewport — the row wraps cleanly._

### Findings — 2026-07-17 (agent axis pass)

Drove the shared axis machinery against `wykonczymy-test` (5435, throwaway `:3010`, OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`, inv 7 perf seed). The percent axis is now surfaced through the consolidated `Widok ▾` popover (EX-435), not a standalone toggle — the underlying `table-columns:kosztorys-progress-display` state and column swap are unchanged. **Core mechanics verified** (percent block swap, `% wykonania` both modes, overshoot raw+red, reload persistence, view-independence). **Remaining open boxes are the counter + section-% surfaces and two edge cases** (denominator-less dash, sub-frame flicker) — not driven this pass:

- [x] **Counter / section-% surfaces driven 2026-07-17 (inv 7 perf seed,** `:3010`**).** Search/filter invariance (counter stays 77,6% under search), per-section `wyk. %` (all sections 77,6%, consistent with the counter), narrow-width toolbar (0 overflow at 900/600px), and picker-wins in percent mode — all verified above. The counter's **money-axis following** is N/A: EX-435 consolidated it to a percent-only "Postęp prac: X%" bar with no value pair. The **only** sub-claim left for the EX-490 E2E is the per-stage-% columns summing to the row's `% wykonania` — a per-cell arithmetic invariant across a virtualized grid. **Test disposition:** e2e (EX-490, filed `e2e-backlog`).

## kosztorys-stages-source-of-truth — „Pomiar z natury" = Σ etapów; „Pozostało" kotwiczone w Przedmiarze (EX-489, EX-495)

**In review** — automated checks green (`c8dea6f`, `1f0d93e`, `f01fd95`, `c09fbcf`; typecheck, unit 914, integration 30, lint, build). Unblocked by EX-494 (the owner's sheet has `O = SUM(D:M)`, verified 435/435 rows). Kills the third input: „Pomiar z natury" is no longer a typed field, it is computed live as the stage sum. The boxes below are the human gate — the read-only „Pomiar z natury" column has no browser-level regression test yet (deferred to the E2E backlog as **EX-497**).

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro) as OWNER/MANAGER, seed a kosztorys into it (`INV=<id> node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/seed-kosztorys.ts` with the seed's DB env pointed at `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`), and ensure ≥2 stages carry recorded progress.

### Phase 1: „Pomiar z natury" staje się sumą etapów

- [x] „Pomiar z natury" nie przyjmuje wpisu; edycja etapu zmienia go natychmiast _Verified 2026-07-17: the_ `measured_qty` _column is **gone** from_ `kosztorys_items` _(migration_ `20260716_0_drop_kosztorys_measured_qty` _applied on the test DB), so Pomiar has no stored field to type into — it is computed as Σ stage qty. Item 392 reads Pomiar = 2 = Σetapów (2 stages at 1). Live recompute-on-stage-edit is the same computed-cell path as S-03 4.7 (already verified there)._
- [x] Wiersz z zerowymi etapami da się skasować, nawet jeśli ma za sobą historię pomiaru _Verified 2026-07-17 (inv 7,_ `:3010` _test DB): took item 405 (Pozycja 1.14, had stage qty 1), zeroed its_ `stage_progress` _to simulate a row cleared after recording pomiar, reloaded → the row read all-zero etapy / Pomiar_ `0,00`_._ `Usuń pozycję` _was enabled (no hard block), deleted with **no confirmation dialog** (_`isRowPopulated`_=false →_ `requiresConfirm`_=false), the row left the grid, and the DB confirms full removal — 0_ `kosztorys_items` _id=405 rows and 0 orphaned_ `stage_progress` _rows (cascade clean). **Test disposition:** integration — the zero-stage delete path is covered by_ `kosztorys-delete-guard.test.ts`_; this drive confirms the source-of-truth variant (guard keys on_ `stage_progress`_, not the dropped_ `measured_qty`_)._

### Phase 2: Kotwica w Przedmiarze

- [x] Wiersz z etapami przekraczającymi Przedmiar: „Pozostało" ujemne, komórka czerwona, licznik > 100% _Verified: item 392 (Przedmiar 1, Σetapów 2) →_ `Pozostało netto = −10,45`_,_ `% wykonania = 200%`_, and the % cell carries_ `text-destructive` _via_ `hasStagesOverPlanned` _(_`kosztorys-v2-columns.tsx:347`_)._
- [x] Wiersz bez Przedmiaru: „Pozostało" = „—", brak czerwieni _Verified 2026-07-17 by code+unit:_ `rowRemainingForView(plannedQty:0) → null` _renders „—" (_`kosztorys-v2-rows.test.ts:282`_), and_ `remainingGross` _preserves the null past the VAT step (_`kosztorys-v2-columns.tsx:378`_) so it never reads a false_ `0` _= „settled";_ `hasStagesOverPlanned(plannedQty:0) → false` _= no red (_`:405`_). The **sort-to-bottom** ordering is the only remaining sliver → e2e (EX-497, filed_ `e2e-backlog`_). **Test disposition:** unit (dash/no-red, covered) + e2e (sort ordering, EX-497)._
- [x] Przełączanie widoku ceny nie zmienia żadnego procentu _Verified — same finding as_ `kosztorys-progress-percent` _› "Percent is view-independent":_ `rowDoneFraction` _has no price term._

### Phase 3: Rabat w wartości przedmiaru

- [x] „Wartość netto przedmiar" przy rabacie 10% jest o 10% niższa niż `Przedmiar × cena`, a tooltip mówi dlaczego _Verified 2026-07-17: the post-discount_ `plannedNet` _math is unit-tested (_`kosztorys-calc.test.ts`_) and applies on screen (item 392 carries a_ `%` _rabat and its Wartość przedmiaru netto is discounted). Owner ruling on the tooltip copy: trimmed to formula-only —_ `Wartość przedmiaru netto = Przedmiar × Cena − Rabat.` _(_`header-tips.ts`_), the_ `− Rabat` _term itself being the "dlaczego". **Test disposition:** unit covers the math; tooltip = no automated test._

### Phase 4: Sprzątanie martwego modelu

- [x] Po `INV=6 … seed-kosztorys.ts` zaseedowany kosztorys ma niezerowy „Pomiar z natury" w wierszach z robotą _Verified on the synthetic_ `perf-seed-kosztorys.ts` _(inv 7): worked rows carry nonzero Pomiar = Σetapów (item 392 = 2, 393 = 11, …). The realistic_ `seed-kosztorys.ts` _(INV=6) reads the **live** Google Sheet and was not re-run this pass; the invariant (Pomiar = Σ stage qty, nonzero where stages exist) is seed-independent — it holds by construction now that_ `measured_qty` _is dropped._
- [x] Odtworzenie kopii zapasowej przywraca etapy, a „Pomiar z natury" liczy się z nich _Verified by construction: snapshots serialize stage rows (S-06, roundtrip-identity tested); with_ `measured_qty` _dropped, restored Pomiar is recomputed from the restored stages — there is no separate measured value to drift. S-06 restore round-trip is already covered by_ `verify-s06.ts` _+ restore-action tests._

### Findings — 2026-07-17 (agent axis pass)

Verified against `wykonczymy-test` (inv 7 perf seed). The kill of the third input („Pomiar z natury" no longer typed) is confirmed at the schema level — `measured_qty` is dropped, so Pomiar is Σetapów by construction, not by a UI convention that could regress. The anchor-in-Przedmiar behavior (negative Pozostało + red + >100%) is confirmed on a live overshoot row. The delete-flow (zero-stage row deletes despite past pomiar) and the no-Przedmiar dash/no-red were driven/verified 2026-07-17. **The one box still open is Phase-3's tooltip copy — an owner wording call, not agent-verifiable.** Sort-to-bottom ordering is owed as browser-level regression **EX-497** (`e2e-backlog`).

## kosztorys-layer-toggle — Praca / Postęp / Bez filtra (widok tabeli)

### Phase 2: UI toggle + editor wiring

> **Superseded surface (2026-07-17):** the „czwarty przełącznik" Praca / Postęp / Bez filtra became the **Warstwy** section of the consolidated `Widok ▾` popover (EX-435) — a `Praca` + `Postęp` checkbox pair. „Bez filtra" = both on; „Praca" = Postęp off; „Postęp" = Praca off; both off hides the layer. Same `table-columns:kosztorys-layer` state underneath. Verified through that surface.

- [x] Czwarty przełącznik renderuje się po przełączniku „Etapy" z segmentami Praca / Postęp / Bez filtra _Verified (superseded form): Warstwy renders in the popover between Kwoty and Etapy as a_ `Praca` _+_ `Postęp` _checkbox pair (four states, incl. both-on = „Bez filtra")._
- [x] „Bez filtra": wszystkie kolumny widoczne (jak dotychczas) _Verified: with both Praca + Postęp checked the full column set renders (subject to the money/etapy axes + picker)._
- [x] „Praca": kolumny per-etap kwoty/brutto/%, „% wykonania" i „Pozostało" znikają; Przedmiar, ceny, Netto/Brutto i etapy-ilość zostają _Verified 2026-07-17 (Postęp off): the grid dropped_ `% wykonania`_,_ `Pozostało netto/brutto` _and the per-stage_ `Etap N — %` _block;_ `Przedmiar`_,_ `Cena j.m. netto`_,_ `Rabat`_,_ `Wartość przedmiaru netto`_,_ `Netto`_,_ `Etap 1…7` _(ilość) and_ `Pomiar` _all stayed._
- [x] „Postęp": kolumny pracy (Przedmiar, ceny, rabat, Wartość przedmiaru, Netto/Brutto, etapy-ilość) znikają; Sekcja, Opis prac i Pomiar zostają, a tracker postępu jest widoczny _Verified (Praca off): columns collapsed to_ `Sekcja`_,_ `Opis prac`_,_ `Pomiar`_,_ `Etap 1…7 — %`_,_ `% wykonania` _— every work column (Przedmiar, ceny, rabat, Wartość przedmiaru, Netto/Brutto, etapy-ilość) gone, progress tracker visible._
- [x] Wybór przeżywa odświeżenie strony _Verified: the axis/layer localStorage keys survive a hard reload (see EX-485/EX-479 persistence)._
- [x] Składa się z osiami netto/brutto i kwoty/% oraz z pikerem kolumn — żadna kolumna nie zostaje zablokowana widoczna/ukryta _Verified: the layer axis narrows independently of the money (Kwoty) and progress (Etapy) axes and of the Kolumny picker; a column the layer hides still reads **checked** in the picker (axis ≠ picker, as confirmed for Kwoty)._

### Findings — 2026-07-17 (agent axis pass)

Warstwy (layer) axis fully verified through the `Widok ▾` popover: Praca-only keeps the work columns, Postęp-only keeps the progress tracker + Sekcja/Opis/Pomiar, both-on is the full grid, and it composes cleanly with the money/etapy axes and the picker. No open boxes for this slice.

## kosztorys-toolbar-view-menu — jeden popover „Widok" zamiast pięciu przełączników (EX-435)

**In review** — automated checks green (`31b3e49`, `a74abd7` + dogfooding follow-up; unit green, typecheck clean for this slice). Ad-hoc change pod parasolem EX-435 (brak własnej karty). Dogfooding follow-up rozszerzył model: każda oś (Kwoty / Warstwy / Etapy) ma teraz czwarty stan `none` (oba boxy odznaczone chowają oś — brak dawnej blokady min-1), Etapy przeszły z radio na parę checkboxów, sekcje przełożone na Kwoty → Warstwy → Etapy → Kolumny, a Kolumny dostały „Pokaż wszystkie". Mapper czterostanowy (`axis-checkboxes.ts`) i predykaty osi (`none → false`) są pokryte unitami.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro) as OWNER/MANAGER, seed a kosztorys into it (`INV=<id> node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/seed-kosztorys.ts` with the seed's DB env pointed at `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`), open the **Kosztorys** tab with ≥1 section, items, ≥2 stages, and clear `table-columns:kosztorys-axis` / `…-layer` w localStorage, żeby startować od `both`.

### Phase 2: Popover „Widok" + przebudowa toolbaru

- [x] **Lewy klaster to dwie kontrolki.** Toolbar pokazuje `Widok cen` (segmenty) + przycisk `Widok ▾`; nie ma osobnych przełączników Kwoty / Etapy / Warstwy, a grupa po prawej nie ma już przycisku `Kolumny`. _Verified 2026-07-17: toolbar carried the_ `Widok cen` _group + a single_ `Widok` _button + search; no standalone Kwoty/Etapy/Warstwy/Kolumny buttons anywhere._
- [x] **Cztery sekcje w kolejności Kwoty → Warstwy → Etapy → Kolumny.** `Widok ▾` otwiera: Kwoty (☑ Netto ☑ Brutto), Warstwy (☑ Praca ☑ Postęp), Etapy (☑ PLN ☑ Procent), Kolumny (checkboxy kolumn + „Pokaż wszystkie") — ikona wiersza po prawej stronie etykiety. _Verified: popover menu emitted_ `Kwoty` _→_ `Warstwy` _→_ `Etapy` _→_ `Kolumny` _in that order, each with its two-checkbox pair, and Kolumny carrying_ `Pokaż wszystkie` _+ the column checkboxes._
- [x] **Checkboxy bez blokady min-1.** Można odznaczyć oba boxy w Kwoty / Warstwy / Etapy — nic nie jest odrzucane; odznaczenie obu chowa kolumny tej osi (pusta tabela jest dozwolonym widokiem). Ponowne zaznaczenie wraca. _Verified on Kwoty: unchecked Netto then Brutto — both accepted (no rejection), the grid dropped every money column (Netto/Brutto/Cena/Rabat/Wartość/Pozostało), leaving only Sekcja/Opis/Etapy-ilość/Przedmiar/Pomiar/J.m.; re-checking Netto+Brutto brought them back._
- [x] **Etapy to para checkboxów** (PLN / Procent), nie radio: oba / jeden / żaden są dozwolone, blok etapów pokazuje kwoty, procenty, oba lub nic. _Verified: Etapy rendered two independent_ `menuitemcheckbox`_es (PLN / Procent); PLN-off + Procent-on swapped the stage block to_ `Etap N — %` _(percent-only), confirming they are not radio._
- [x] **Tylko Kolumny ma tooltip.** Info-ikona jest przy nagłówku Kolumny (hint o niezależnym ukrywaniu); Kwoty / Warstwy / Etapy mają czyste nagłówki. _Verified: only the Kolumny header carried a_ `Więcej informacji` _button; Kwoty / Warstwy / Etapy headers were plain text._
- [x] **„Pokaż wszystkie" w Kolumny.** Ukryj kilka kolumn, kliknij „Pokaż wszystkie" → wszystkie wracają; pozycja jest wyszarzona, gdy nic nie jest ukryte; menu zostaje otwarte. _Verified 2026-07-18 (browser, 5435 test DB, INV=6): ukryto kolumnę Sekcja (nagłówek + 27 komórek zniknęły), „Pokaż wszystkie" przywróciło ją (nagłówek + 27 komórek wróciły); przy niczym ukrytym pozycja ma_ `aria-disabled="true"` _(wyszarzona); popover pozostał otwarty (trigger_ `data-state="open"`_) przez cały przepływ._
- [x] **Kolumny nie zamykają menu.** Przełączenie kilku kolumn pod rząd zostawia popover otwarty; kolumny znikają/wracają na bieżąco. _Verified 2026-07-18: przełączenie checkboxa **kolumny** Sekcja (nie osi) ukryło ją na bieżąco, a popover pozostał otwarty (_`data-state="open"`_); ponowne „Pokaż wszystkie" przywróciło ją, menu wciąż otwarte._
- [x] **Wybory przeżywają odświeżenie** dokładnie jak przed zmianą (te same klucze localStorage — brak migracji). _Verified:_ `kosztorys-axis`_,_ `kosztorys-progress-display`_, and_ `kosztorys-view:7` _all survived a hard reload._

### Findings — 2026-07-17 (agent axis pass)

The consolidated `Widok ▾` popover is confirmed structurally and behaviorally against `wykonczymy-test` (inv 7): four sections in order, Kolumny-only tooltip, four-state axes with no min-1 lock, Etapy-as-checkbox-pair, and localStorage persistence. Three boxes (`Pokaż wszystkie` restore flow, per-column no-close, Warstwy Praca/Postęp drop behavior) remain a quick owner confirm — not driven this pass. **This slice (EX-435) is not** `Done`**: its own relations + the** `kosztorys-layer-toggle` **Warstwy behavior below are unverified.**

## kosztorys-global-discount — Globalny rabat (EX-501)

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro; migration applied there, seed a kosztorys first — the dump carries none). Log in as **OWNER/MANAGER** (editor needs MANAGEMENT_ROLES). Open an investment's **Kosztorys** tab with ≥1 section and items carrying per-pozycja rabaty, so the override is observable.

### Phase 4: UI — kontrolka rabatu + dwie sumy

_Driven 2026-07-17 (browser, 5435 test DB, INV=6 seed 43 poz., VAT 8%, Suma netto 1940,00 / brutto 2095,20)._

- [x] **Rabat procentowy → nadpisanie.** „%" + 10 → cztery kolumny rabatu per pozycja znikają z siatki i z pikera „Widok", a pasek sum pokazuje Rabat −194,00 / Do zapłaty netto 1746,00 / brutto 1885,68.
- [x] ~~\*\*Obie sumy zgodne~~ → jedno źródło, jeden pasek.** Premisa nieaktualna: duplikat „Suma" w panelu Sekcje **celowo usunięto\*_ (commit c6dc24e — „two totals one source"). Jest jeden pasek sum pod siatką (`kosztorys-totals-bar.tsx`), zasilany jednym `doZaplatyNet` z hooka edytora; `kosztorys-section-summary.tsx` renderuje tylko podsumy per sekcja, bez agregatu. Zweryfikowano brak drugiego bloku „Suma". _(Naprawiono przy okazji 2 nieaktualne komentarze wskazujące usunięty blok — Step 2.)\*
- [x] **Oś netto/brutto.** Widok → odznaczenie „Netto" zwija pasek do brutto-only („Suma brutto 2095,20 / Rabat −194,00 / Do zapłaty brutto 1885,68"); oba zaznaczone = netto+brutto. Napędza go `moneyAxis` (`showNet`/`showGross`).
- [x] **Rabat kwotowy → płaskie odjęcie.** „kwota zł" + 200 → Do zapłaty netto 1740,00 (płaskie −200, nie procent).
- [x] **Wyczyszczenie rabatu → powrót.** „brak" → cztery kolumny rabatu per pozycja wracają do siatki, pasek wraca do „Suma netto 1940,00 / Suma brutto 2095,20".
- [x] **Snapshot + odtworzenie.** Zapisano wersję „rabat-10pct-test" z rabatem 10% (payload `settings.globalDiscountType=percent, globalDiscountValue=10`), wyczyszczono rabat do „brak", odtworzono → rabat wrócił (pasek 1746,00; `investments` id=6 → `percent|10`). Round-trip przez `snapshot-format.ts` → `restore-kosztorys.ts`.
- [x] **Marża karty inwestycji bez zmian** (poza zakresem). Potwierdzone przez kod: `globalDiscount` czytany **wyłącznie** przez ścieżki edytora kosztorysu (query/calc/serialize/restore); żadna kalkulacja finansowa w `src/lib/db/` nie odwołuje się do `global_discount` — marża liczona z transferów, strukturalnie odłączona.

## kosztorys-section-append — Dodaj sekcję z szablonu (EX-503)

**In review** — automated checks green (Phase 1 `8be1d07`, Phase 2 `f86b98c`; integration specs a–e + unit/typecheck/lint clean). Ad-hoc slice pod EX-503.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro). Log in as **OWNER/MANAGER** (editor wymaga MANAGEMENT_ROLES). Najpierw zapisz **dwa różne szablony** z sekcjami: zseeduj kosztorys, „Zapisz jako szablon" pod dwiema nazwami (najlepiej z różnymi sekcjami, w tym jedną o powtórzonej nazwie jak „Łazienka"). Otwórz **Kosztorys** inwestycji z ≥1 sekcją do testu „niepustego".

### Phase 2: Picker + oba wejścia + patch siatki

_Driven 2026-07-17 (browser, 5435 test DB). Fixtures: two presets crafted — „Szablon Wiatrołap A" (section Wiatrołap, 43 poz.) saved via „Zapisz jako szablon…" from INV=6, and „Szablon Łazienka B" (section Łazienka, 43 poz.) — a copy of A with the section renamed, inserted directly into_ `kosztorys_presets` _(test-DB fixture). Entry point is the toolbar **+** menu → „Sekcja z szablonu…" (not a „Dodaj" button)._

- [x] **Niepusty kosztorys, bez przeładowania.** **+** → „Sekcja z szablonu…" → zaznaczono Łazienka (Szablon B) + Wiatrołap (Szablon A) → „Dodaj (2)" → obie wylądowały **na końcu** (INV=6: sekcje id 345 Łazienka 43 poz., 346 Wiatrołap 43 poz.), **przedmiar = 0** na obu (`sum(planned_qty)=0`), URL bez zmiany (bez przeładowania), panel „Sekcje" pokazuje je na końcu listy.
- [x] **Pusty kosztorys → kompozycja à-la-carte.** Pusty INV=8: blokujący dialog „Zacznij kosztorys" ma przycisk „Dodaj sekcje z szablonu" → złożenie Łazienka + Wiatrołap → dialog zniknął, edytor wypełniony (28+ wierszy), DB = dokładnie dwie sekcje (347 Łazienka 43, 348 Wiatrołap 43), **bez śmieciowej pustej sekcji** (ścieżka remountu).
- [x] **Wyszukiwarka + nagłówki grup + liczniki.** Piker grupuje po szablonie (nagłówki „Szablon Łazienka B" / „Szablon Wiatrołap A"), liczniki „43 poz." poprawne; wpisanie „zienka" filtruje do samej Łazienki. _(Uwaga: cmdk używa dopasowania podciągiem — „Ła" trafia też w Wiatro**ł**ap; to poprawne działanie filtra, nie błąd.)_
- [x] **Duplikat nazwy dozwolony.** INV=6 miał już „Wiatrołap" (id 343); dodanie Wiatrołap z Szablonu A dało **drugą** sekcję „Wiatrołap" (id 346) — obie w siatce, obie edytowalne.
- [x] **Brak szablonów → stan pusty** _(verified by code + częściowo live)._ Po `DELETE FROM kosztorys_presets` piker **nadal** listował szablony — `listPresetSectionsAction` jest za `unstable_cache`, więc surowy DELETE nie unieważnia tagu (artefakt środowiska testowego, nie błąd produktu). Gałąź pustego stanu jest jednoznaczna w kodzie (`add-sections-from-preset-dialog.tsx:122-123` → „Brak zapisanych szablonów."), a „Dodaj" jest strukturalnie nieaktywne przy zerze zaznaczeń (potwierdzone live: `confirmDisabled=true`).

### Findings — 2026-07-17

- [x] **Preset list cache maskuje usunięcie przez SQL** — `listPresetSectionsAction` (`unstable_cache`) nie odświeża się po bezpośrednim `DELETE FROM kosztorys_presets`, więc live-render pustego stanu „Brak zapisanych szablonów." nie był osiągalny bez unieważnienia cache. **Nie jest to błąd** — produkcyjne usunięcie szablonu przechodzi przez akcję z rewalidacją tagu; to wyłącznie artefakt ręcznego czyszczenia fixtury w passie QA. **Test disposition:** no automated test — środowiskowy, nie ścieżka produktowa.

## kosztorys-section-inline-rename — edytowalna komórka Sekcja

**In review** — automated checks green (Phase 1 `abc1a1d`; typecheck/lint/unit clean). E2E deferred (patrz Testing Strategy w planie).

### Phase 1: Editable Sekcja cell

_Driven 2026-07-18 (browser, 5435 test DB, INV=6, sekcja id 343 „Wiatrołap", 27 wierszy). Napędzane przez natywny React_ `onChange`_/_`onKeyDown` _na_ `<input>` _w_ `SectionNameCell` _— bariera „trusted events" dsg dotyczy tylko aktywacji komórki (mousedown/paste), nie handlerów zwykłego inputa._

- [x] Edycja komórki Sekcja i wyjście z pola (blur) zmienia nazwę na **każdym** wierszu tej sekcji w siatce. _Verified: rename na „Wiatrołap TEST" → wszystkie **27** komórek Sekcja pokazały nową nazwę, DB_ `kosztorys_sections.name` _id=343 = „Wiatrołap TEST"._
- [x] Enter zatwierdza; Escape cofa do poprzedniej nazwy bez zapisu. _Verified: Escape na wpisanym „Wiatrołap ESCAPE" → input wrócił do „Wiatrołap TEST" (0 komórek z „ESCAPE", 27 z „TEST"), DB bez zmian („Wiatrołap TEST"); Enter na „Wiatrołap ENTER" → zapis, DB id=343 = „Wiatrołap ENTER". Gałąź_ `cancelRef` _w_ `section-name-cell.tsx:42-47` _bramkuje pominięcie zapisu przy Escape._
- [x] Panel sekcji pokazuje nową nazwę po zmianie z siatki. _Verified: panel „Sekcje" wyrenderował nową nazwę jako_ `<span class="truncate">` _po rename z siatki._
- [x] Nowa nazwa przeżywa przeładowanie strony (zapisana). _Verified: po hard-reload wszystkie 27 komórek Sekcja nadal pokazywały zapisaną nazwę (odczyt z DB)._
- [x] Zaznaczenie komórki Sekcja i wciśnięcie Delete NIE czyści nazwy sekcji. _Verified przez kod (failure mode strukturalnie niemożliwy):_ `kosztorys-v2-columns.tsx:243` \*_`deleteValue: ({ rowData }) => rowData` _— Delete zwraca wiersz bez zmian, więc nie może wyczyścić* `sectionName`*. Nie wymaga sterowania klawiszem na aktywnej komórce dsg.\*
- [x] Ukrywanie/pokazywanie i zmiana szerokości kolumny Sekcja nadal działają. _Verified (ukrywanie/pokazywanie): przez menu_ `Widok ▾` _→ Kolumny → checkbox „Sekcja" ukrył kolumnę (nagłówek + 27 komórek zniknęły), „Pokaż wszystkie" przywrócił. Zmiana szerokości: natywny resize dsg, poza zasięgiem tej zmiany (podmieniła tylko renderer komórki_ `SectionNameCell`_, nie konfigurację szerokości/ukrywania kolumny) — nietknięty, nie sterowany osobno (trusted drag na uchwycie resize)._

## kosztorys-editor-compile-fix — EX-496 cleanup tail (EX-496)

**In review** — the React-Compiler memoization attempt (Phase 2, `4c7a1cd`) was **reverted**: routing
cell handlers through `KosztorysEditorProvider` context churned the context value every render and
re-rendered every visible cell (context bypasses `React.memo` / grid per-row memoization) → "slow and
jumpy". Owner confirmed by manual A/B that the reverted (props-path) editor is smooth again. Only the
cleanup fixes remain: #4 cache tag (`aa35411`), #6/#7 dead-code + cast removal (`0e4bd16`), `Pick<>`
narrowing (`5e6a9a6`). The row-action / rename behaviors are back to the pre-change (already-shipped,
already-working) code, so they need no re-verification.

Setup: uruchom app przeciw dev DB (5433), zaloguj się jako OWNER/MANAGER, otwórz **Kosztorys**
inwestycji z ≥1 sekcją i ≥1 etapem oraz kilkoma pozycjami.

### Wydajność (regresja p2 — cofnięta)

- [x] Edytor jest płynny przy pisaniu w komórkach — bez „lag/jumpy" — po cofnięciu p2 (potwierdzone ręcznie przez ownera, 2026-07-17).

### Ustawienia globalne (guard #4 — cache tag, NIE cofnięte)

- [x] Zmiana **stawki VAT / współczynnika globalnego / rabatu globalnego** odzwierciedla się w siatce i sumach **bez ręcznego przeładowania** (potwierdzone ręcznie przez ownera, 2026-07-17).

## S-07 — kosztorys-undo (re-integracja na staging)

**Owed — nie zweryfikowane na staging.** Cała ta lista (14 pozycji) przeszła na gałęzi
`feat/kosztorys-undo` (2026-07-12, DB `db-test` 5435, inwestycja 7, ~~1000 pozycji). Ten slice to
**re-integracja** zweryfikowanych plików silnika + re-implementacja integracji edytora (~~249 linii)
na obecnym kształcie staging (po EX-515). Testy automatyczne przechodzą (tsc/eslint/unit); poniższe
checki trzeba przejść ponownie **na kodzie staging**, bo integracja jest napisana od nowa. Każdy
check potwierdza **utrwalony stan DB** (odczyt psql), nie tylko wartość na ekranie — undo uzgadnia
żywy debounced saver + `prevById` i wysyła realne odwrotne zapisy serwerowe. To jedyny blocker do
`Done`; przeglądowy E2E jest osobno odroczony (EX-525, `e2e-backlog`).

Setup: app przeciw dev DB (5433), zalogowany jako OWNER/MANAGER, otwarty **Kosztorys** inwestycji
z ≥1 sekcją, ≥1 etapem i kilkoma pozycjami.

### Faza 1: undo edycji siatki i zmiany kolejności

- [x] 1.a Edytuj komórkę → Cmd+Z cofa wartość w siatce **i** w DB; Cmd+Shift+Z ponawia. _Zweryfikowano 2026-07-17 (app :3010 vs test DB 5435, inw. 6): edycja Cena j.m. netto poz. 1435 → Cmd+Z przywrócił wartość w DB (_`client_price`_), Cmd+Shift+Z ponowił. Wymaga jednego nieprzerwanego wpisania (pauza >700 ms rozbija na 2 wpisy stosu — artefakt testowy, nie bug)._
- [x] 1.b Edytuj postęp etapu → undo/redo odwraca/przywraca zmianę, sumy sekcji (Pozostało / Suma) przeliczają się. _Zweryfikowano: edycja qty etapu poz. 1435 →_ `stage_progress.qty_done` _w DB odwrócone przez Cmd+Z / przywrócone przez Cmd+Shift+Z; Pomiar (Σetapów) i Pozostało przeliczyły się na ekranie._
- [x] 1.c ▲▼ zmień kolejność wiersza → undo przywraca pierwotną kolejność (`display_order` w DB), redo ponawia. _Zweryfikowano: „Akcje wiersza" → „Przesuń w dół" na poz. 1435 (sekcja 343) → swap_ `display_order` _w DB (1436→0, 1435→1); Cmd+Z przywrócił (1435→0), Cmd+Shift+Z ponowił swap. Każdy krok potwierdzony psql._
- [x] 1.d Przyciski paska ⟲/⟳ robią to samo i poprawnie się wyłączają na końcach stosu (pusty undo / pusty redo). _Zweryfikowano: świeży load → oba (Cofnij/Ponów) wyłączone; po reorderze → Cofnij aktywny, Ponów wyłączony; klik **Cofnij** odwrócił_ `display_order` _w DB (1436→0 z powrotem na 1435→0) i przełączył Cofnij→wyłączony/Ponów→aktywny; klik **Ponów** ponowił swap w DB i wyłączył Ponów na końcu stosu. Przyciski robią dokładnie to samo co Cmd+Z/Cmd+Shift+Z i gasną na obu końcach stosu._
- [x] 1.e **Współistnienie z Cmd+Z:** podczas pisania w komórce Cmd+Z robi natywne cofnięcie znaku (nie zdejmuje ze stosu); po zatwierdzeniu/blur Cmd+Z zdejmuje ze stosu. _Zweryfikowano na strażniku_ `activeElement` _(_`use-undo-keyboard.ts:20-27`_): ze stosem = 1 (reorder) i sfokusowanym_ `input` _komórki → Cmd+Z_ `defaultPrevented=false` _(handler ustępuje natywnemu undo), stos NIETKNIĘTY (Cofnij nadal aktywny,_ `display_order` _w DB bez zmian = swap trzyma). Po blur (_`activeElement=BODY`_) → Cmd+Z_ `defaultPrevented=true`_, stos zdjęty (DB wróciło do bazowej kolejności, Cofnij→wyłączony, Ponów→aktywny). Granica dowodu: natywne cofnięcie znaku w polu jest funkcją przeglądarki i odpala tylko na zdarzeniu trusted — syntetyczny_ `KeyboardEvent` _go nie wywoła; rozstrzygająca gwarancja (nasz globalny handler ustępuje w trakcie edycji, działa po blur) jest udowodniona bezpośrednio._
- [x] 1.f Wklejenie wielu komórek cofa **jedno** Cmd+Z (jeden batch `onChange` = jeden wpis; burst-coalescing). _Zweryfikowano 2026-07-18 (app :3010 vs test DB 5435, inw. 6): dwie edycje etapów poz. 1435 (Etap1=169→5, Etap2=170→6) wykonane **synchronicznie w jednym ticku** (obie w oknie 700 ms_ `UNDO_COALESCE_MS`_) →_ `stage_progress` _w DB = 169:5, 170:6; **jeden** klik Cofnij przywrócił **oba** (169→0, 170→0) i opróżnił stos (Cofnij→wyłączony) → burst = jeden wpis stosu. Granica dowodu: syntetycznego **wklejenia** dsg nie da się wysterować przez Playwright MCP (dsg aktywuje komórkę tylko na zdarzeniu trusted), więc gwarancję „multi-cell burst → jeden wpis" udowodniono przez dwie synchroniczne edycje, które trafiają w **tę samą** ścieżkę_ `pendingStages` _→ jeden_ `flushUndoBuffer` _→ jeden command; ścieżka „jeden_ `onChange` _z N zmianami" (wklejenie) domknięta przez odczyt kodu (_`onChange` _akumuluje wszystkie zmienione wiersze) + jednostkowo testowany_ `coalesceStageChanges`_._

### Faza 2: undo edycji z panelu

- [x] 2.a Zmień nazwę sekcji → undo przywraca starą nazwę w nagłówku i w DB; redo ponawia. _Zweryfikowano 2026-07-18 (test DB 5435, inw. 6): komórka Sekcja „Wiatrołap" (sekcja 343) → „Wiatrołap RENAMED" →_ `kosztorys_sections.name` _w DB = RENAMED; **Cofnij** → DB z powrotem „Wiatrołap"; **Ponów** → DB znów RENAMED (nagłówek siatki odzwierciedla)._ `pushReversible('Zmiana nazwy…')`_._
- [x] 2.b Zmień VAT inwestycji → undo przywraca stawkę; Brutto każdego wiersza przelicza się z powrotem. _Zweryfikowano (inw. 6): VAT 8%→23% w panelu „Opcje" →_ `investments.vat_rate` _w DB = 0.23; Brutto wierszy przeliczyło się na ekranie (160×1.23=196,80; 35×1.23=43,05); **Cofnij** → DB_ `vat_rate`_=0.08 z powrotem._
- [x] 2.c Zmień współczynnik globalny i sekcji → undo przywraca każdy; pochodne ceny podwykonawców przeliczają się z powrotem. **Edge:** współczynnik sekcji ustawiony z **null** (dziedziczenie) → undo wraca do **null**, nie 0. _Wysterowano na żywo 2026-07-18 (app :3010 vs test DB 5435, inw. 6, widok „Z narzędziami"). **Globalny:** mnożnik globalny w drugim rzędzie toolbara (`kosztorys-global-settings.tsx`, widoczny tylko pod widokiem podwykonawcy „Z narzędziami"/„Bez narzędzi", nie „Klient") 0.65→0.80 → `investments.w_tools_coeff` w DB = 0.8; **Cofnij** → DB = 0.65. **Sekcyjny (edge null→null):** mnożnik sekcji za popoverem (ikona `SlidersHorizontal` w panelu „Sekcje", `kosztorys-section-summary.tsx:130`), sekcja 343 startuje z `w_tools_coeff`=NULL → wpisano 0.70 → DB `0.7`, `IS NULL`=f; **Cofnij** → `SELECT COALESCE(w_tools_coeff::text,'<NULL>'), w_tools_coeff IS NULL` = **`<NULL>|t`** → undo wróciło do **NULL, nie 0**. Ścieżka `pushReversible`→`runGridReversal`→zapis odwrotny→DB; edge null→null dodatkowo jednostkowo testowany (`inverseSectionCoeffPatch`)._
- [x] 2.d Przeplataj edycję panelu z edycjami siatki i cofaj przez granicę w ścisłym LIFO. _Zweryfikowano (inw. 6): panel VAT 8%→23% (command A), potem siatka Cena netto poz. 1435 160→200 (command B) → DB [vat 0.23, price 200]; **Cofnij #1** → tylko B cofnięte (price 160, vat **wciąż** 0.23); **Cofnij #2** → A cofnięte (vat 0.08); stos pusty (Cofnij wyłączony, Ponów aktywny). Ścisły LIFO przez granicę panel↔siatka potwierdzony psql-em na każdym kroku._

### Findings — 2026-07-18

- [x] **2.c: kontrolka współczynnika — ZLOKALIZOWANA i wysterowana 2026-07-18** — mnożnik globalny renderuje się w drugim rzędzie toolbara tylko pod widokami podwykonawcy („Z narzędziami"/„Bez narzędzi"), nie „Klient" (`kosztorys-global-settings.tsx`) — stąd nieodnaleziony w poprzednim przebiegu (był na widoku Klient); mnożnik sekcyjny siedzi za popoverem `SlidersHorizontal` w panelu „Sekcje" (`kosztorys-section-summary.tsx:130`). Undo obu potwierdzone psql-em, z edge sekcja 343 NULL→0.70→undo→**NULL** (`<NULL>|t`). Patrz check 2.c powyżej.
- [x] **3.a–3.c: interwał auto-snapshotu — WYSTEROWANE na żywo 2026-07-18** — pierwotnie odłożone (interwał produkcyjny 10 min niepraktyczny), przejechane w dedykowanej sesji z `AUTO_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS` chwilowo obniżonym do 4 s (edycja tylko lokalna, zrewertowana `git checkout` po teście — **nie** wchodzi do commita). Wszystkie trzy potwierdzone psql-em na `kosztorys_snapshots` inw. 6: 3.a bezczynność → 383 bez zmian; 3.b jedna edycja → dokładnie jeden nowy (384), potem cisza; 3.c po restore wymuszony pre-restore snapshot (385), a idle tick nie dokłada snapshotu przywróconego drzewa (`handleRestored` przesuwa marker `lastSnapshotRevision = revisionRef+1`). Patrz checki 3.a/3.b/3.c powyżej. **Test disposition:** bramka rewizji → integration (mock timera, assert wywołań `snapshotAction`) nadal warta dołożenia jako tańsza/pewniejsza regresja niż live e2e; obecnie niepokryte automatem.
- [x] **3.d: wymuszony snapshot przed usunięciem — WYSTEROWANY 2026-07-18** — premisa potwierdzona w kodzie (`removeSectionAction`→`captureAutoSnapshot`, `kosztorys.ts:217`; analogicznie `:334`/`:435` dla pozycji/etapu — server-side, bezwarunkowo) i na żywo: usunięcie sekcji 344 wstawiło `kosztorys_snapshots` id=383 (`kind=auto`) mimo braku edycji. Patrz check 3.d powyżej. **Test disposition:** integration (akcja delete → assert wstawiony snapshot) — nadal warto dołożyć jako regresję, obecnie niepokryte automatem.

### Faza 3: bramka „dirty" bezczynnego snapshotu

- [x] 3.a Otwórz edytor i zostaw bezczynny przez ≥1 tick interwału → **żaden** nowy snapshot `auto` się nie pojawia (Wersje / DB). _Wysterowano na żywo 2026-07-18 (app :3010 vs test DB 5435, inw. 6) z `AUTO_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS` chwilowo obniżonym do 4 s (rewert po teście, plik nietknięty w commicie): świeży mount, 15 s bezczynności (≥3 ticki) → `max(id) kosztorys_snapshots` bez zmian (383). Bramka `revisionRef === lastSnapshotRevision` → return._
- [x] 3.b Zrób jedną edycję, poczekaj tick → **dokładnie jeden** nowy snapshot `auto`; ponowna bezczynność → brak kolejnych. _Wysterowano na żywo 2026-07-18 (interwał 4 s): jedna edycja panelu VAT 8→9 (`investments.vat_rate`=0.09, bump rewizji) → po ticku **jeden** nowy snapshot (id 384, `kind=auto`); kolejne 8 s bezczynności → nadal 384 (marker dogonił rewizję, następne ticki puste)._
- [x] 3.c Po restore bezczynny tick **nie** tworzy snapshotu właśnie przywróconego drzewa (marker przesunięty za bump z reset()). _Wysterowano na żywo 2026-07-18 (interwał 4 s): „Opcje → Wczytaj" → drawer „Wersje" → „Przywróć" najstarszej auto-wersji + potwierdzenie. Restore wstawił wymuszony **pre-restore** snapshot (id 385) — oczekiwane (`restoreSnapshotAction`→`captureAutoSnapshot`, `kosztorys-snapshots.ts:79`) — a następny bezczynny tick (9 s) **nie** dołożył snapshotu przywróconego drzewa (`max(id)`=385 bez zmian). `handleRestored` ustawia `lastSnapshotRevision = revisionRef+1` (`kosztorys-editor-v2.tsx:89`), więc tick po restore trafia w równość i nie snapshotuje._
- [x] 3.d Wymuszony snapshot przed usunięciem (usuń pusty etap/sekcję) nadal powstaje mimo aktywnej bramki. _Wysterowano na żywo 2026-07-18 (app :3010 vs test DB 5435, inw. 6): usunięto sekcję 344 („Nowa sekcja", 1 poz.) przez UI (trash → potwierdzenie „Usuń") → sekcja zniknęła (`SELECT count(*)…id=344`=0), a `kosztorys_snapshots` dostał **nowy** wiersz `id=383, kind=auto, taken_at=08:20:23` (poprzedni max=382) mimo braku edycji od ostatniego snapshotu. Ścieżka: `removeSectionAction`→`captureAutoSnapshot` (server-side, `kosztorys.ts:217`, bezwarunkowo przed `payload.delete`); ten sam wzorzec przy usuwaniu pozycji/etapu (`kosztorys.ts:334,435`). Snapshot jest w akcji serwerowej, nie w hooku klienta — stąd poprzedni grep po hooku go nie znalazł._

### Faza 4: hardening cyklu autosave↔undo (EX-526)

**Zweryfikowane 2026-07-18.** Te checki bronią 5 fixów z EX-526 (uzgodnienie komend undo z cyklem
optymistycznego autosave). Sedno: pojedyncza serializowana kolejka zapisów per-klucz (`save-lanes.ts`)

- `pruneByIds` na usunięciu wiersza + reaktywna flaga `hasPendingBurst`. To wyścigi czasowe (zapis
  w locie vs zapis odwrotny), więc każdy check wymaga **wywołania w oknie czasowym** — okno koalescencji
  undo (700 ms `UNDO_COALESCE_MS`) jest **dłuższe** niż debounce zapisu (500 ms), więc gdy powstaje
  komenda undo jej zapis w przód już wystartował. Każdy check potwierdza **utrwalony stan DB** (psql),
  nie ekran. Setup jak wyżej (OWNER/MANAGER, Kosztorys z ≥1 sekcją/etapem/pozycjami, test DB 5435).

**Metoda dowodu (2026-07-18).** Sedno każdego checka to wyścig **poniżej 700 ms** — a round-trip
Playwright/MCP ma większą latencję niż samo okno, więc wyścigu **nie da się deterministycznie odtworzyć
w przeglądarce** (łapanie klatka-po-klatce to dokładnie anty-wzorzec, przed którym ostrzega skill). Dowód
jest dwuwarstwowy: **(1) deterministyczny kontrakt jednostkowy** — 24 testy zielone (`save-lanes.test.ts`
5, `use-undo-redo.test.ts` 12, `undo-coalesce.test.ts` 7) pokrywają serializację per-klucz, `pruneByIds`
i połykanie błędu bez odrzucenia kolejki; **(2) ślad okablowania** — potwierdzone w `use-kosztorys-editor.ts`,
że kod produkcyjny faktycznie spina te kontrakty (ścieżki niżej). Runtime potwierdzono tam, gdzie okno
NIE jest sub-700 ms: toolbar renderuje Cofnij+Ponów, oba wyłączone bez historii (`canUndo || hasPendingBurst`
= false, `canRedo && !hasPendingBurst` = false), konsola czysta.

- [x] 4.a **Zapis odwrotny ląduje PO zapisie w przód, nie ściga go (EX-526 #1/#3).** Wpisz wartość w komórkę Cena j.m. netto i **natychmiast** (w oknie <700 ms, gdy debounced zapis w przód jest w locie) zrób Cmd+Z. Po ustaniu ruchu: DB (`client_price`) = **wartość sprzed edycji** (cel undo), nie nowa wartość zostawiona przez wyścig. Powtórz kilka razy z różnym timingiem — kolejka per-klucz ma zawsze serializować odwrotny za zapisem w locie.
      → **Dowód:** `save-lanes.test.ts` „serializes same-key writes (EX-526 #1)" + „failed write doesn't block next same-key write" — odwrotny enqueue'owany podczas zapisu w locie zawsze uruchamia się PO nim (kontrakt deterministyczny). Okablowanie: `useDebouncedSave` trzyma jeden zestaw lane'ów per mount (`createSaveLanes`), a odwrotne z `runGridReversal` idą przez `runNow` → te same lane'y na kluczu `item:<id>:<field>` / `progress:<id>:<stageId>`. Wyścig sub-700 ms nieodtwarzalny przez MCP (patrz Metoda dowodu).
- [x] 4.b **Undo po usunięciu wiersza nie odtwarza osieroconych zapisów (EX-526 #2).** Edytuj komórkę / postęp etapu w wierszu, potem usuń ten wiersz (trash → potwierdzenie), potem Cmd+Z. Oczekiwane: **żaden** zapis nie idzie na usunięte id, w DB **nie** pojawia się osierocony `stage_progress` (ani `items` row) dla skasowanego id, brak błędu w konsoli. `pruneByIds` ma zdjąć komendy dotykające skasowanych id z obu stosów (Cofnij/Ponów gasną odpowiednio).
      → **Dowód:** `use-undo-redo.test.ts` grupa „pruneByIds (EX-526 #2)" — 4 testy: zdejmuje komendy dotykające skasowanego id z obu stosów, przycina burst nawet gdy dotyka też żywych wierszy, zachowuje strukturalne (bez `touchedIds`), bumpuje rewizję tylko gdy faktycznie przyciął. Okablowanie: usuwanie przycina **przed** akcją serwera — `handleRemoveItem` `pruneByIds([row.id])` (521) → `removeItemAction` (522); `handleRemoveSection` `pruneByIds(removed.map(r=>r.id))` (680) dla kaskady. Więc żadna komenda dotykająca skasowanego id nie może zostać na stosie do odtworzenia.
- [x] 4.c **Nieudany zapis odwrotny czysto się wycofuje, bez unhandled rejection (EX-526 #3).** Wymuś błąd zapisu odwrotnego (np. offline w DevTools tuż przed Cmd+Z, albo ubij akcję serwerową). Oczekiwane: **toast błędu**, siatka **re-syncuje** do prawdy serwera (`router.refresh`), **żaden** unhandled promise rejection w konsoli. Kolejka łapie i logiczny `!success`, i rzucony wyjątek — nigdy nie odrzuca.
      → **Dowód:** `save-lanes.test.ts` „routes logical failure to onError" + „routes thrown/rejected to onError — never rejects lane" — `enqueue` łapie i `!res.success`, i rzucony wyjątek, woła `onError`, `void`-uje ogon, więc nic nie ucieka jako unhandled rejection. Okablowanie (diff EX-526): każdy odwrotny w `runGridReversal` dostaje teraz `onError = revertOne(...)`, który **cofa optymistyczny apply do wartości sprzed-rewersji** — bo `rows` to zamrożony przy mount useState seed (EX-441), więc sam `router.refresh()` nie zsynchronizowałby siatki (komentarz w kodzie 364–372). Toast + revert + brak escape'u.
- [x] 4.d **Cofnij aktywne w oknie koalescencji; Ponów wyłączone (EX-526 #5).** Tuż po edycji (zanim 700 ms flush domknie burst) przycisk **Cofnij** jest **aktywny** i Cmd+Z działa (burst liczy się jako cofalny); **Ponów** wyłączone gdy burst w toku. Krawędź drenażu: jeśli błąd-revert opróżni bufor, Cofnij **nie** zostaje fałszywie aktywne (`clearBurstIfEmpty` — czyści flagę). Toolbar i Cmd+Z zgadzają się co do dostępności.
      → **Dowód:** ślad kodu — dostępność wyprowadzona z `canUndo: canUndo || hasPendingBurst` (1034) i `canRedo: canRedo && !hasPendingBurst` (1035), więc w oknie burst Cofnij jest aktywny a Ponów wygaszony jedną i tą samą flagą, którą czyta też Cmd+Z. `clearBurstIfEmpty` (184) kasuje flagę gdy `dropPendingField`/`dropPendingStage` (błąd-revert) opróżni bufory — krawędź drenażu. Runtime potwierdzony na baseline (bez historii oba przyciski wyłączone). ⚠ Samo okno burst jest sub-700 ms → nieobserwowalne przez MCP, a `hasPendingBurst` żyje w god-module `use-kosztorys-editor` bez harnessu testowego (odłożone z EX-515) → patrz Finding poniżej (dług testowy).

#### Findings — 2026-07-18 (Faza 4)

- [x] **`hasPendingBurst` / `canUndo`-w-oknie-burst bez zautomatyzowanej straży — filed EX-521.** Logika
      dostępności Cofnij/Ponów w oknie koalescencji (4.d) jest wyprowadzona poprawnie (`canUndo || hasPendingBurst`,
      `canRedo && !hasPendingBurst`, `clearBurstIfEmpty`) i potwierdzona śladem kodu, ale **nie ma testu**
      i nie da się jej deterministycznie zaobserwować przez MCP (okno sub-700 ms). Zachowanie poprawne —
      brak fixa, brakuje straży. Owed unit dopięty do **EX-521** (wyjęcie hooka `use-kosztorys-editor` za
      harness `renderHook` — twardy prerequisite): (a) burst ustawia `hasPendingBurst` → `canUndo` true zanim
      flush; (b) `clearBurstIfEmpty` po revert opróżniającym bufor gasi flagę. **Test disposition:** TDD ·
      unit — czysta logika reduktora flagi; blokada = brak harnessu (EX-521), nie sama logika.

## EX-519 — refaktor powłoki dialogów (PR #26)

**Zweryfikowano 2026-07-18 — ostatnia noga bramki przed wyjściem z In Review.** PR #26 podmienił
chrome dialogów na współdzielone `FormDialogShell` + `DialogActions` (ścieżka `FormDialog`) oraz
ujednolicił `DialogHeader` (`title`/`description`) dla dialogów arkuszy. Ryzyko regresji: refaktor
dotknął dialogów **poza** edytorem, więc każdy trzeba potwierdzić, że nadal się **renderuje**, a jego
submit/cancel/close nadal **działa** (dla dialogów finansowych — że **utrwala wiersz w DB**). Pass
przejechany Playwrightem przeciw **test DB 5435** (`:3010`, `.next-e2e`), zalogowany jako
`e2e@wykonczymy.test` (OWNER, świeże logowanie po wylogowaniu z niepewnej sesji).

**Zakres dowodu.** Pełną ścieżkę submitu przez powłokę (`FormDialogShell`→`DialogActions`→akcja→DB)
udowodniono na **dwóch strukturalnie różnych** formularzach z realnym zapisem do DB (deposit —
pojedyncze pole; expense — tablica pozycji). Dla pozostałych sprawdzono kompozycję powłoki (render z
nagłówkiem i przyciskami akcji) + wiring zamknięcia (Escape **oraz** jawny „Anulu"/„Nie"), bo ścieżkę
submitu potwierdzają już te dwa zapisy — wszystkie migrowane dialogi dzielą te same komponenty powłoki.

Setup: app przeciw **5435 test DB**, OWNER, dane z dumpa prod (2932 transakcje, 32 kasy) + zaseedowany
kosztorys (inw. 7 ~1128 pozycji; inw. 9 pusty — na dialogi stanu pustego).

### Dialogi finansowe (realne dane prod na test DB)

- [x] **deposit** (Wpłata „Nowa wpłata") — render z powłoką ✓; submit **utrwalił** wiersz (`transactions` id=3807, `INVESTOR_DEPOSIT`, 1234.56, opis-marker) ✓; dialog zamknął się po sukcesie ✓. Kasa+inwestycja (Radix combobox) i kwota/opis wypełnione, „Dodaj" → zapis.
- [x] **expense** (Wydatek „Nowy wydatek") — render ✓; submit **utrwalił** wiersz (`transactions` id=3808, `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE`, 777.77, `settled=f`) ✓; zamknięcie po sukcesie ✓. Formularz z tablicą `lineItems[0]` + typ wydatku — inna struktura niż deposit, ta sama powłoka.
- [x] **edit-transfer** („Edytuj transakcję") — render ✓ (wiersz transakcji → „Edytuj transakcję"); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **internal-transfer** („Transfer między kasami") — render ✓ (przycisk „Kasa" na `/kasy`, dwa comboboxy kas); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **cancel-transfer** („Anulowanie transakcji", `alertdialog`) — render ✓ (wiersz → „Usuń"); klik **„Nie"** zamyka bez mutacji ✓ (nie potwierdzono anulowania — realny wiersz).
- [x] **add-investment** („Nowa inwestycja") — render ✓ (`/inwestycje` → „Dodaj"); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **edit-investment** („Edytuj inwestycję") — render ✓ (karta inwestycji → „Edytuj"); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **add-worker** („Nowy pracownik") — render ✓ (`/pracownicy` → „Dodaj"); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **edit-worker** („Edytuj pracownika") — render ✓ (`/pracownicy/56` → „Edytuj"); Escape zamyka ✓.

### Dialogi kosztorysu (edytor v2, inw. 7 / pusty inw. 9)

- [x] **add-sections-from-preset** („Dodaj sekcję z szablonu") — render ✓ (menu „+" → „Sekcja z szablonu…", Anuluj/Dodaj); „Anuluj" zamyka ✓.
- [x] **save-version** („Zapisz wersję") — render ✓ (menu „Opcje" → „Zapisz", Anuluj/Zapisz); jawny **„Anuluj"** zamyka ✓ (potwierdza wiring `DialogActions` cancel odrębny od Escape).
- [x] **save-preset** („Zapisz jako szablon…") — render ✓ (menu „Opcje" → „Zapisz jako szablon…", Anuluj/Zapisz); zamknięcie ✓.
- [x] **empty-kosztorys** („Zacznij kosztorys") — render ✓ (pusty kosztorys inw. 9, przyciski „Utwórz sekcję"/„Wypełnij z szablonu"/„Dodaj sekcje z szablonu").
- [x] **seed-from-preset** („Wypełnij z szablonu") — render ✓ (przycisk w dialogu stanu pustego otwiera picker szablonu, ułożony na „Zacznij kosztorys").

### Dialogi arkuszy / leadów (`DialogHeader` title/description)

- [x] **sheet-setup** („Kosztorys inwestycji") — render ✓ (`/inwestycje` → „Dodaj kosztorys"); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **add-sheet** („Nowy kosztorys") — render ✓ (`/kosztorysy` → „Nowy kosztorys"); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [x] **sheet-button** — render ✓: przy `hasSheet` to link „Otwórz" (`/inwestycje/31`), bez arkusza otwiera `SheetSetupDialog` („Kosztorys inwestycji", zweryfikowany wyżej).
- [x] **sync-button** (reset) — render ✓ (`/inwestycje/31/kosztorys` → „Zresetuj wydatki inwestycyjne" → `ConfirmDialog` „Zresetować zakładki…"); klik **„Anuluj"** zamyka bez wywołania API ✓. Ścieżka „Synchronizuj" (preview `DialogActions`) **niewysterowana** — bije w **żywe Google Sheets** (patrz Findings).
- [x] **lead-answers** („szczegóły leada") — render ✓ (`/zgloszenia` → „Szczegóły", nagłówek = nazwa leada, treść read-only); Escape zamyka ✓.
- [ ] **link-sheet-to-investment** („Dodaj kosztorys do inwestycji") — **niewysterowany w przeglądarce**: trigger „Powiąż inwestycję" renderuje się tylko dla arkusza **bez** podpiętej inwestycji, a test DB nie ma takiego sieroty (wszystkie `kosztoryses` mają `investment_id`). Powłoka potwierdzona przez kod: ten sam `DialogHeader` z `ui/dialog` co zweryfikowany `add-sheet` (który jest jego „przyciętym klonem"). Patrz Findings.

### Findings — 2026-07-18

- [ ] **link-sheet-to-investment — brak fixtury osieroconego arkusza w test DB.** Dialog nie renderuje się bez wiersza `kosztoryses` z `investment_id IS NULL`, którego dump prod nie zawiera. **Needs human:** albo (a) zaseedować osierocony arkusz w test DB i przejechać render+submit, albo (b) zaakceptować dowód z kodu (identyczna powłoka `DialogHeader` jak zweryfikowany `add-sheet`) jako wystarczający dla tej nogi bramki. Uwaga: SA nie ma quoty Drive, więc nie utworzy nowego arkusza — fixtura musiałaby wskazać istniejący, udostępniony sheet id. **Test disposition:** e2e — powiązanie sieroty z inwestycją to ścieżka wielogranicowa przez UI; dołożyć spec do `e2e-backlog` gdy fixtura arkusza będzie dostępna.
- [ ] **sync-button „Synchronizuj" preview — niewysterowany (żywe Google Sheets).** Przycisk „Synchronizuj wydatki inwestycyjne" wywołuje `previewMaterialSync` (odczyt **żywego** arkusza) i dopiero potem otwiera dialog preview z `DialogActions` — nie odpalony, by nie ruszać żywych danych. Powłoka reset-`ConfirmDialog` z tego samego komponentu potwierdzona (render+Anuluj). **Needs human:** zdecydować, czy render dialogu preview wymaga osobnego przejazdu (bezpieczny odczyt na dedykowanym arkuszu testowym) czy dowód z kodu wystarcza. **Test disposition:** e2e z mockiem `sheets-sync` — wielogranicowe (akcja→Google→dialog); `e2e-backlog`.
- [x] **Ostrzeżenie React „state update on a component that hasn't mounted" na kosztorys_v2 — artefakt dev/HMR, nie bug.** Pojawiło się raz **w trakcie cyklu [Fast Refresh] rebuild**; czysta nawigacja na tę samą trasę = **0 błędów** w konsoli. Odrzucone jako szum dev-mode (niezwiązany z EX-519). **Test disposition:** brak automatu — artefakt HMR, nie odtwarza się na produkcyjnym buildzie.

## EX-527 — cmdk fuzzy→substring (`foldFilter`)

`Command` (`ui/command.tsx`) domyślnie ustawia teraz filtr cmdk na współdzielony `foldFilter`
(`lib/utils/fold-text.ts`) — dopasowanie **ciągłym podłańcuchem**, nieczułe na diakrytyki i wielkość
liter. Zastąpiło to wbudowany scorer cmdk (fuzzy **podsekwencja** + ranking), który przy wyszukiwaniu
bez ogonków po cichu gubił akcentowane opcje. Wszystkie konsumenty dziedziczą domyślny filtr —
**żaden nie nadpisuje `filter=`** (potwierdzone grepem): `form-combobox`, `transfers/filter-select`,
`transfers/filter-multi-select`, `kosztorys/add-sections-from-preset-dialog`, `kosztorys/kosztorys-view-menu`
(picker „Widok ▾"). Setup: OWNER, test DB 5435.

**Zakres dowodu.** Filtr jest współdzielony i bezstanowy — jeden przejazd na żywym konsumencie
(picker „Widok ▾", ma akcentowane etykiety) + kontrakt jednostkowy dowodzą samego filtra; pozostałe
cztery konsumenty różnią się tylko listą opcji, nie logiką filtrowania, więc pokrywa je ten sam
domyślny `foldFilter`.

- [x] **Kontrakt jednostkowy `foldFilter`/`foldText`** — `fold-text.test.ts` 6/6 zielonych: zdejmuje
      diakrytyki + lowercase (`Źródło`→`zrodlo`, `Wartość`→`wartosc`), fałduje `ł/Ł` które NFD zostawia
      (`Łódź`→`lodz`, `Materiał`→`material`), dopasowuje **ciągły podłańcuch nie podsekwencję**
      (`Wartość`⊃`rtos` = 1, ale fuzzy `wrs` = 0), zwraca 0 przy braku trafienia.
- [x] **Wyszukiwanie bez ogonków trafia akcentowaną etykietę (żywy konsument).** Picker „Widok ▾" na
      `/inwestycje/6/kosztorys_v2`: `zrodlo` → tylko „Źródło ceny wykonawcy"; `wartosc` → „Wartość
      przedmiaru netto" + „Wartość przedmiaru brutto". Diakrytyki nieczułe end-to-end w cmdk.
- [x] **Substring, nie subsequence (żywy konsument).** W tym samym pickerze `wrs` (podsekwencja „Wartość")
      → **0 wyników**. Stary scorer fuzzy by to dopasował — potwierdza, że substring-filtr zastąpił
      subsequence-scorer w działającej apce, nie tylko w unicie.
- [x] **Caveat `ł` domknięty w kodzie.** Ticket zgłaszał, że `lodz` nie trafi „Łódź" (NFD zostawia `ł`).
      `fold-text.ts` 8–9 jawnie fałduje `ł→l`/`Ł→L`; unit `foldFilter('Łódź','lodz')===1` to potwierdza.
      Brak dalszej decyzji — caveat rozwiązany, nie odłożony.
- [x] **Żaden konsument nie nadpisuje filtra.** `grep filter= ` po pięciu plikach konsumentów = 0 trafień;
      wszystkie dziedziczą `filter ?? foldFilter` z `Command`. Więc jeden zweryfikowany żywy konsument + współdzielony unit pokrywają cały zestaw.

### Findings — 2026-07-18 (EX-527)

- [x] **Brak regresji fuzzy-subsequence — potwierdzone, nie założone.** Ticket prosił o sprawdzenie,
      czy jakiś flow polegał na dopasowaniu podsekwencją (np. `wrs` → „Wartość rows"). Żywy przejazd
      pokazał `wrs`→0 i sensowne trafienia substring — substring jest akceptowalny, nie trzeba
      przywracać rankingu cmdk. **Test disposition:** unit (`fold-text.test.ts`) już pokrywa kontrakt
      substring-nie-subsequence; per-konsument to eyeball-w-przeglądarce (bez automatu) — zgodnie z tickiem.

## investment-planowana-status — „Planowana" investment status (EX-506)

**Verified 2026-07-18** — full Playwright + DB pass against the 5435 test DB, logged in as E2E User (OWNER). Created prospect id 309 „EX506 Prospekt Test". All checks green.

Setup: app on 5435 test DB (migrated with `pnpm db:migrate:test` so `enum_investments_status` carries `planowana`); log in through the form as OWNER.

### Findings — 2026-07-18

_None. All checks passed; no bugs, regressions, or console errors surfaced during the pass._

## kosztorys-bridge — Podsumowanie R/M, etap axis, komentarz, zaliczki, R+M footer (EX-530)

**Verified 2026-07-18** — Playwright + DB pass against the 5435 test DB, logged in as E2E User (OWNER), on `/inwestycje/6/kosztorys_v2` (seeded rozpiska, 43 items, 6 etapy, VAT 8%, rabat 10%). Migration `20260718_1_add_kosztorys_stage_to_transactions` applied clean with `pnpm db:migrate:test` (also the prod dry-run). One bug found + fixed on the spot.

> **RETIRED (EX-536):** the deposit→etap tagging bridge below (Phase 4 „Zaliczka na etap" select, Phase 5 R+M-nets-zaliczki, and the empty-string-SelectItem finding) was **removed** — `kosztorys_stage_id` dropped from `transactions` (migration `20260721_0`), `zaliczki.ts` deleted, the deposit form's stage select gone. Deposits now live in the Podsumowanie wpłaty list, untagged. Do **not** re-run these checks; they exercise a deleted feature. Kept as history.

- [x] **Phase 1 — Podsumowanie split** — Robocizna 1134,90 / Materiały 25 223,57 / Łącznie 26 358,47; 1134,90 + 25 223,57 = 26 358,47; udział 4% / 96% / 100%. Robocizna netto == „Do zapłaty netto" in the totals bar.
- [x] **Phase 2 — etap axis** — „Suma transzy" table Etap 1–6 + „Suma prac wykonanych": netto 0 / 122,85 / 257,40 / 637,00 / 0 / 243,75 summing to 1261,00 = Suma prac wykonanych; brutto row present and consistent (×1.08).
- [x] **Phase 3 — Komentarz column** — present in the „Widok" → Kolumny picker; toggling it on renders „Komentarz" as the rightmost editable grid column (`note`, textColumn). (`note` plumbing pre-existed; only the column registration is new.)
- [x] **Phase 4 — zaliczki tag end-to-end** — Wpłata (INVESTOR_DEPOSIT) → investment Apenińska → „Zaliczka na etap" select renders Etap 1–6 + „— brak —"; tagged 500 zł to Etap 2 → persisted (`transactions.kosztorys_stage_id = 176`, ordinal 2) → editor „Zaliczki" row shows 500,00 under Etap 2 (total 500,00).
- [x] **Phase 5 — R+M footer nets zaliczki** — „Aktualnie do zapłaty (R + M)" = 25 858,47 netto = robocizna 1134,90 − zaliczki 500 + materiały 25 223,57; brutto 27 927,15 (×1.08). With zero zaliczki it equals Łącznie (26 358,47); Łącznie itself is unaffected by zaliczki (split vs. footer separation confirmed).

### Findings — 2026-07-18

- [x] **Empty-string SelectItem crashes the deposit „Zaliczka na etap" select** — the „— brak —" option used `value=""`, which Radix Select forbids, throwing a Runtime Error the moment an investment with etapy was chosen in the Wpłata form. Fixed at `src/components/forms/deposit-form/deposit-form.tsx:49` (sentinel `NO_STAGE = 'none'`, mapped back to `undefined` in `toData`). Re-verified: select opens, tags a deposit, no crash.
      **Test disposition:** test-driven-debugging · e2e — the defect is a browser-only render crash (Radix invariant) not reachable from a unit test; regression guard filed to `e2e-backlog` as **EX-531** (deposit → zaliczka flow), where the regression assertion travels with the eventual spec.

### Owner sign-off — 2026-07-18

- [x] **Robocizna base / R+M netting semantics confirmed** — owner ruled the „Podsumowanie" Robocizna row stays on **executed work** (suma prac wykonanych, `T`-derived `doZaplatyNet`), and „Aktualnie do zapłaty (R + M)" nets `executed − zaliczki + Materiały`. No code change. This was the last archive blocker (review-gate F3).

## robocizna-from-kosztorys + summary-charts + recon-suspense (branch-wide gate re-cover)

**Verified 2026-07-19** — light Playwright + curl + DB smoke pass against the 5435 test DB, logged in as E2E User (OWNER). W1 on the seeded recon fixtures (investments 117–132, „E2E Recon mismatch …", each with a 1-item kosztorys + LABOR_COST/RABAT tx); summary charts on `/inwestycje/14/kosztorys_v2` after seeding a small kosztorys (3 sekcje × 6 pozycji, 3 etapy) onto investment 14 via direct SQL (the `perf-seed-kosztorys.ts` Payload boot hung — see note). Render + no-false-scream-under-filter only; **no domain sign-off** (the mismatch figures are fixture-designed to diverge).

- [x] **W1 — recon block renders + verdict is filter-independent.** `/inwestycje/117`: „z kosztorysu (netto)" renders without crash — Robocizna 500,00 (RED „Niezgodność"), Rabat 0,00 (RED). Adding `?type=LABOR_COST` (page stats correctly changed: Bilans −420→−450, Rabat row dropped, table 2→1 rows, wybranych 6/6→5/5) left the recon block **identical** — both mismatch badges still present. Verdict stable across the filter ⇒ the fix holds (block fetches investment-wide `fetchFilteredByType({investment})` + `deriveFinancials`, not the page's URL `where`). _Note: a raw `page.evaluate` momentarily read 0 badges — a Suspense-streaming timing artifact; the authoritative accessibility snapshot (waits for stability) confirmed both badges persist under the filter._
- [x] **W2 — Suspense skeleton is neutral and resolves, no layout jump.** Server-streamed HTML of `/inwestycje/14` (curl w/ session cookie) contains the neutral fallback „Wczytywanie z kosztorysu…" (spinner, `GradientSpinner`), the string „zgodne" appears **0×** anywhere (no false green cue while loading), and „z kosztorysu (netto)" streams in 6× (boundary resolves to the real block). Skeleton and resolved block share the same outer shape (`Separator` + `Description` „z kosztorysu (netto)" + row), so no heading jump on resolve; resolved block visually confirmed on 117 & 14. _The transient fallback wasn't photographed live: the 18-item tree resolves server-side sub-100ms, and heavy client CDP throttling stalls the whole dev RSC payload instead of exposing the gap — curling the raw stream is the honest, deterministic evidence for a server-streamed fallback._
- [x] **W3 — summary breakdown / section charts render clean.** `/inwestycje/14/kosztorys_v2` Podsumowanie renders with **0 console errors/warnings**: Materiały breakdown (Materiały budowlane 21 280,19 / 32%, Materiały wykończeniowe 43 363,00 / 66%, Łącznie 66 176,19), „Suma transzy" per-etap netto/brutto table, section shares (Udział w całości kosztorysu 33,3% ×3), „Suma prac wykonanych" 1533,00 (RED mismatch), Rabat 0,00 (RED), Wpłaty 159 421,00, Do zapłaty −93 244,81. _No literal SVG pie chart exists in this editor view — the „section chart" is the Udział % breakdown (`kosztorys-podsumowanie.tsx` renders tables, not recharts); the offer-view pie in `offer-view-footer.png` is a not-yet-built target state, so its absence is not a defect._

### Findings — 2026-07-19

Pass ran clean — **no bugs found**, all three checks pass, W1 verdict-stability confirmed. **0 open findings**; nothing blocks these slices from `Done` on rendering grounds. Any judgment on whether a given robocizna/rabat/materiały figure is domain-correct remains an owner call (the 117/14 figures are fixture mismatches by design and were not signed off).

- [ ] **`perf-seed-kosztorys.ts` Payload boot hangs against the 5435 test DB** — two runs (foreground + background) sat >5 min with 0 rows written (stuck before the first `payload.create`, no stdout), so the 1000-item synthetic seed never completed; worked around with a direct-SQL small seed onto investment 14. **Needs human:** confirm whether `getPayload({ config })` in a standalone `node --import tsx` script reliably boots against `DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST` (5435) — if this is a real regression it also blocks the documented seed path in AGENTS.md, not just this pass. **Test disposition:** no automated test — a dev-tooling/seed-script boot issue, not product behavior; cheaper to reproduce by hand than to guard, but worth a human confirm before trusting the seed docs.

### Housekeeping — 2026-07-19

- Test DB left dirty: investment 14 now carries a synthetic 3-section / 18-item / 3-stage kosztorys (direct SQL, no `kosztoryses` sheet-link row) plus its stage_progress; the 117–132 E2E recon fixtures are untouched. Reseed/reset via `pnpm db:import:test` + `pnpm db:migrate:test` (kosztorys content is throwaway).

## kosztorys-client-share (S-13 / EX-532)

**Owed 2026-07-20** — implemented, automated checks green. These are the browser-level facts no unit
test covers: an unauthenticated session, a real clipboard, and the actual bytes a client receives.
Run against the dev app (5433 DB) as OWNER, plus one genuinely logged-out browser profile.

- [x] **Public link works with no session** — „Udostępnij" → „Wygeneruj link" → copy → open in a
      private window (no `payload-token` cookie): the kosztorys renders, grid + footer, no redirect
      to `/zaloguj`. `/k/bogus` → 404.
- [x] **No subcontractor prices anywhere on the public page** — with the page open, the „Widok"
      cost-variant controls (z narzędziami / bez narzędzi, coefficients, per-item overrides) are
      absent from the toolbar AND from the column set; the network payload for `/k/<token>` contains
      no `costVariant` / `coeff` / `Override` key. Payload, not just the DOM.
- [x] **Grid is genuinely read-only** — clicking a cell does not open an editor, typing does nothing,
      no row can be added, removed or reordered.
- [x] **Rotate invalidates the old URL** — „Wygeneruj nowy" while the old link is open in the private
      window: reload → 404; the new link works.
- [x] **Revoke kills the link, preview survives** — „Wyłącz link" → old URL 404s, and
      „Podgląd" (`/podglad-klienta/<id>`) still renders for the owner.
- [x] **It is live, not a snapshot** — change a per-etap quantity in the editor, reload the public
      URL: the new figure and the recomputed totals are there.
- [x] **Preview and public URL render identically** — same rows, same columns, same footer figures,
      side by side.
- [x] **MANAGER cannot share** — as a MANAGER, „Udostępnij" → „Wygeneruj link" is refused with the
      Polish error; no row appears in `kosztorys_shares`.

## kosztorys-client-view-reuse (S-13 / EX-532)

**Owed 2026-07-20** — implemented, automated checks green (typecheck, lint, 1082 unit tests, build).
This change replaces the bespoke `ClientKosztorysView`/`ClientKosztorysFooter` render with a read-only
reuse of the admin `KosztorysEditorBody` in `clientView` mode. The share-link lifecycle boxes in the
**kosztorys-client-share** section above still stand (that machinery is untouched); the boxes here are
the render-swap facts those don't cover. Run as OWNER against the dev app plus one logged-out profile.

- [x] **`/k/<token>` renders the owner grid + footer, read-only** — verified cookie-less on `/k/<token>`
      (test DB, inv 7): real grid + Podsumowanie footer render; slim header = investment name + money-axis
      toggle only; no toolbar, no section sidebar/summary.
- [x] **Recon scream absent** — no `Niezgodność` text / `ReconMismatchBadge` in the footer on either
      `/k/<token>` or `/podglad-klienta/7`.
- [x] **Internal links are plain text** — after the EtapTotals fix below, **0 `<a href>` anchors** on the
      whole public page; „Wpłaty" renders as a plain `SPAN`.
- [x] **Every cell is non-editable** — all 561 data cells carry `dsg-cell-disabled` (the 17 non-disabled
      are header cells); a click on a data input is intercepted by the disabled cell overlay, so no editor
      opens and typing can't reach the input. Owner editor by contrast shows 372 editable data cells.
- [x] **No save/snapshot network request from the client page** — zero non-static requests fired on
      `/k/<token>` (pure server render; no `updateItemField`/autosave/snapshot/action calls).
- [x] **Section pie is gone from the client view** — no `section-pie` / „Udział sekcji" on either client
      surface.
- [x] **Owner preview matches the public view** — `/podglad-klienta/7` and `/k/<token>` render identically
      (same header „Madalinskiego 67", all cells disabled, 0 anchors, money-axis toggle, no pie, no recon,
      „Do zapłaty" present) — both via the reused body.
- [x] **Live owner editor unchanged** — `/inwestycje/7/kosztorys_v2` as OWNER: full „Widok" toolbar,
      372 editable data cells, app chrome intact (the `clientView` flag defaults off).

### Findings — 2026-07-21

- [x] **„Wpłaty" leaked as an internal `<Link>` on the client page** — `KosztorysEtapTotals` rendered the
      „Suma transzy" block's „Wpłaty" label as `<Link href="/inwestycje/<id>?type=…">` unconditionally and
      never received `clientView`, so the public `/k/<token>` (and `/podglad-klienta`) shipped a clickable
      internal route into the client's DOM. The sibling `KosztorysPodsumowanie` already gated its Wpłaty +
      materiały links on `clientView`; this component was missed. **Fixed:** threaded `clientView` through
      `KosztorysTotalsPanel` → `KosztorysEtapTotals` and render „Wpłaty" as plain text when set (mirrors the
      sibling). Re-verified: 0 anchors on the client page, owner keeps the link. `kosztorys-etap-totals.tsx`,
      `kosztorys-totals-panel.tsx`.
      **Test disposition:** e2e — same public-page browser surface as the CRITICAL view-pin guard; folded
      into **EX-550** (add "no `<a href>` internal links on `/k/<token>`" to its assertions). No unit layer
      reaches the rendered clientView footer.

### Re-verify — 2026-07-21 (post-merge refactors + revoke-confirm, `baee9b68`)

Covers the surfaces the earlier pass predates: undo/redo React-context → prop, `ownerOnly` → `editorOnly`
rename, merge field rename `laborCostsNetFromTransactions`, money-axis label, `copyToClipboard` extraction,
and the new revoke `ConfirmDialog`. Driven as OWNER against the test DB (5435, inv 7, 1000-item perf seed)
on `:3010`, plus the cookie-less `/k/<token>`.

- [x] **Undo/redo stack reaches the body via prop (not context)** — toolbar „Cofnij"/„Ponów" start disabled
      (canUndo/canRedo=false), a structural edit (VAT) enables „Cofnij", and clicking the **„Cofnij" toolbar
      button reverts the edit end-to-end** (VAT 30→7 in the field _and_ `investments.vat_rate` in the DB),
      leaving „Cofnij" disabled again (stack emptied). Proves the shell's `useUndoRedo()` is passed as the
      `undoRedo` prop and drives the toolbar deep in the body + executes the command's effect. Keyboard
      Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Shift+Z also observed toggling both stacks correctly.
- [x] **Client body defaults to `NOOP_UNDO_REDO`** — `/k/<token>` renders with no undo chrome and a fully
      inert grid (below); the read-only body takes no `undoRedo` prop and nothing throws.
- [x] **`editorOnly` (renamed from `ownerOnly`) gates mutation handlers by render-mode** — OWNER can add a
      section via „Nowa sekcja" (`kosztorys_sections` for inv 7 went 10→11, persisted); the CLIENT grid
      exposes **0 editable inputs** and no add/remove/rename chrome. Both branches of the gate exercised.
- [x] **`laborCostsNetFromTransactions` reconciliation renders** — owner Podsumowanie panel shows all figures
      (Netto/Brutto/Wpłaty per etap, „Suma prac wykonanych", „Materiały budowlane", „Łącznie", „Rabat",
      „Do zapłaty" 269 945,43 in red = the recon scream). The merge field rename didn't break the recon read.
- [x] **Money-axis label „Oba" → „Pokaż wszystko"** — renders in the client slim header toggle
      (`["Netto","Brutto","Pokaż wszystko"]`); the „Pokaż wszystko" (`both`) axis shows netto+brutto columns.
- [x] **Client read-only + price-pin holds** — `/k/<token>`: 528/561 cells `dsg-cell-disabled`, 0 editable
      inputs, **0 `<a href>` anchors** (Wpłaty fix intact), no undo/share/sekcje chrome. Forcing
      `localStorage['kosztorys-view:7']='w_tools'` and reloading leaves only client price columns (no
      wykonawca/mnożnik column) and client prices (row 1 brutto 21,60 = client 20×1.08, not wykonawca ~11,88).
- [x] **`copyToClipboard` util (share + add-sheet dialogs)** — share dialog „Kopiuj link" writes the link to
      the clipboard (`navigator.clipboard.readText()` returned the `/k/<token>` URL); success path runs.
- [x] **Revoke `ConfirmDialog` (new)** — „Wyłącz link" opens a confirm titled „Wyłączyć link dla klienta?"
      with the irreversibility copy + „Anuluj"/„Wyłącz link". **Cancel** dismisses it with the link intact;
      **confirm** deletes the `kosztorys_shares` row (count 1→0), flips the dialog to the no-token „Wygeneruj
      link" state, and the token stops resolving to the kosztorys (`/k/<token>` now renders the 404 page, no
      grid — Next dev serves it with a 200 wrapper, but the content is not-found, not the data).

**Findings (all pre-existing, orthogonal to this slice's diff — none block the slice):**

- [x] **Keyboard Ctrl+Z undo is focus-flaky** — after a `CoeffField` commit (VAT/coeff) + the async
      `router.refresh()`, an editable input sometimes retains focus, so `useUndoKeyboard` bails (native browser
      undo wins) and Ctrl+Z becomes a no-op; other times it fires cleanly. The toolbar „Cofnij"/„Ponów"
      buttons are the reliable path and always work. Already flagged in-code at
      `src/components/kosztorys/use-undo-keyboard.ts:6-11` as "needs browser verification". Untouched by
      EX-532. **Filed onto EX-525** (the S-07 undo/redo Cmd+Z E2E already owed) with the focus-race case + the
      harden-vs-accept-buttons-only decision + test disposition — pre-existing, not introduced by this slice,
      so not a per-slice blocker. **Needs human (tracked in EX-525):** decide whether to harden focus detection
      (read dsg active-cell edit state, or scope the listener to the grid container) or accept buttons-only.
      **Test disposition:** e2e — real focus + async-refresh timing; no unit/integration layer reproduces the
      focus race. Cheapest real signal is a Playwright spec (in EX-525's scope).
- [x] **Structural-command undo (VAT/coeff) registers ~2.7s after the edit** — `handleVatChange` awaits the
      server action (recomputes all 1000 rows' brutto) before `pushReversible`, so „Cofnij" stays disabled and
      an undo attempt is a no-op during that window. Correct by construction (can't undo before the change
      persists), but surprising on large kosztorysy. Dropped — behavior is correct; not worth a guard.
- [x] **VAT field shows a float artifact `7.000000000000001`** — `vatRate*100` in JS (0.07×100). Cosmetic,
      pre-existing (`CoeffField` value from `tree.vatRate*100`). Dropped — not worth the churn; a `parseFloat`
      round on display would fix it if ever revisited.

## EX-529 — kosztorys-summary-charts

**In review** — automated checks green (tsc, eslint, unit 7/7 on the slice seam, `pnpm build`). The
two footer pies are new UI; the slice math (`sectionPieSlices` / `costPieSlices` base selection +
fill cycling) is unit-tested, so the boxes below are the render/layout/parity gates CI can't reach.
Stacked on **ex-532** (`kosztorys-client-view-reuse`) — verify after that base is in place.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro) as OWNER, seed a kosztorys into it
(`INV=<id> node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/seed-kosztorys.ts`, DB env pointed at
`DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`), open the investment's **Kosztorys** tab and expand the „Podsumowanie" footer.
For the client-share row, mint a share token and open `/k/<token>`.

### Phase 1: Restore the charting stack

- [x] `pnpm dev` starts and the editor renders unchanged (no visual/behaviour delta before the pies mount).
- [x] No lightningcss/Tailwind CSS build error after the `recharts` install (the arm64 trap).

### Phase 3: Mount both pies in the footer

- [x] **Both pies render beside the summary table.** The „Podsumowanie" footer shows the section pie +
      the cost pie to the right of the summary grid (wrapping below on a narrow window); the collapsed
      panel still shows the „Do zapłaty" headline.
- [x] **Section slices match the panel + sum to 100%.** Each section's slice equals its per-section value
      in the section-summary panel at the client price, and the slices sum to the whole (100%).
- [x] **Przedmiar ↔ Wykonane toggle re-partitions.** Flipping the section-pie base re-slices the pie and
      updates the legend heading („Udział sekcji — przedmiar" / „— wykonane"); **no money figure in the
      summary table moves** (the pie is view-invariant, the table is not the pie's source).
- [x] **Cost pie matches the summary rows.** The cost pie's Robocizna + per-category materiały slices
      equal the summary table's corresponding rows (agreement by construction — same figures).
- [x] **Client-share parity, no owner-only leakage.** `/k/<token>` renders the same two pies with no
      internal `<Link>`s and no mismatch scream — parity with the owner view minus the owner-only chrome.
- [x] **Fresh offer (executed = 0) renders under the default Przedmiar base.** On a kosztorys with no
      executed work, the section pie still renders (przedmiar-priced), not a blank/empty chart.
- [x] **Negative korekta in the cost pie (owner policy) — RESOLVED, leave as-is (owner, 2026-07-21).**
      A negative korekta / „Pozostałe koszty" (`CORRECTION` credit) is a **legacy artifact blocked in
      new investments** — it exists only on archived investments (~1% of data, e.g. inv 31). Owner
      ruling: leave the pie as-is (it mirrors the summary table, incl. the credit row — correct
      behavior). No code change; no guard owed (the edge is only reachable on frozen archive data no
      new flow writes).

### Findings — 2026-07-21 (verify-manual-checks pass, OWNER, 5435 test DB)

Driven against inv 6 (perf-seed, 10 sections × 100 items, executed present, materiały + wpłaty
transactions), inv 7 (perf-seed with stage_progress stripped → executed = 0), and inv 31 (real
transactions incl. 9 `CORRECTION` credits). View-invariance verified explicitly: toggling the widok
cen z narzędziami → Klient left the section-pie slices at 86 984,25 while the summary table + section
panel re-priced — the pie is view-invariant as designed (`progressSubtotals` is fixed to `'client'`
and not memoized on `view`, `use-kosztorys-editor.ts:346`).

Cross-checks that passed by exact value (not just eyeball): cost-pie Robocizna 1 373 774,00 /
Materiały budowlane 24 805,57 / Materiały wykończeniowe 418,00 == the summary rows byte-for-byte;
section-pie **Wykonane** slice 67 541,25 == the Sekcje panel's client-priced net 67 541,25
(= przedmiar 86 984,25 × 77,6% executed); the przedmiar↔wykonane toggle left the summary grid text
byte-identical before/after.

- [x] **Negative korekta reaches the cost pie — reproduced on real data, RESOLVED (owner, 2026-07-21).**
      On inv 31 the „Struktura kosztów" pie + summary both show „Korekta (bez kategorii) **-300,00**"
      with a **„-0%"** legend row (`cost-structure-pie.tsx` → `costPieSlices`, `chart-slices.ts:45`).
      **Owner ruling: leave as-is** — negative korekta is a legacy artifact blocked in new investments,
      present only on archived data (~1%), and the pie correctly mirrors the summary table. No code
      change; no test owed (the edge is unreachable by any new flow).
- [x] **0-value Robocizna slice shows in the cost-pie legend on a fresh offer (benign).** With executed
      = 0 (inv 7) the cost pie lists „Robocizna 0% 0,00" while zero-value _materiały_ categories are
      filtered out (`chart-slices.ts:51` filters `item.net !== 0`, but robocizna is always pushed). The
      asymmetry is intentional-looking (robocizna is the headline cost category and reads fine at 0) and
      recharts draws no arc for a 0 value, so nothing is visually broken. Dismissed as benign — not
      fixed to avoid a judgment call on whether a 0 robocizna row should ever hide.
      **Test disposition:** no automated test — cosmetic legend content, cheaper to eyeball; no defect.

## kosztorys-zaliczka-v2 — materiały netto/brutto w Podsumowaniu (slice A)

### Phase 1: Materiały as brutto through the waterfall + formula hint

- [ ] Podsumowanie in **Netto** axis: „Materiały", each category row, Łącznie, and Do zapłaty all show `brutto/(1+VAT)`; in **Brutto** axis they show the raw amount; the two columns differ by the VAT.
- [ ] The formula hint appears on materiały rows and reads correctly (VAT subtracted).
- [ ] Robocizna („Suma prac wykonanych") figures are unchanged; udział percentages still sum sensibly.
- [ ] Client-share view (`clientView`) renders the same derived figures without owner-only links/screams.

## kosztorys-tryb-mieszany — cash-settlement view w Podsumowaniu (slice B)

> **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-23/24, EX-536):** the **manual `C` cash input** below was **removed** — the owner flipped tryb mieszany to derive the cash (netto) part from **Σ netto wpłaty** (deposits bucketed by `vatPlane`, null⇒netto), not a typed field. Checks referencing typing `C` exercise a deleted control; do **not** run them. The live Mieszane behavior is verified in the consolidated batch section below (`kosztorys-podsumowanie-tabs`). Kept as history.

### Phase 2: Panel wiring + cash-settlement UI

- [ ] Panel opens on **Netto** by default; grid columns/toggle default unchanged (still show all).
- [ ] „Mieszana" shows netto-only waterfall + „Suma transzy" netto + the three cash rows.
- [ ] ~~Typing `C` recomputes Reszta and Razem live~~ — **removed control (see SUPERSEDED note above).**
- [ ] Netto and Brutto axes unchanged from before.
- [ ] Client preview (`clientView`) shows the block with a **disabled** input.

## kosztorys-podsumowanie-tabs — zaliczka-v2 batch: tabbed Podsumowanie, Mieszane via vatPlane, wpłaty base fix (EX-536)

**Not yet driven** — collected at the branch-wide review gate (`.review-gate/staging-batch-2026-07-24.md`), authored per the "no manual checks; register them" directive. Consolidates the manual surface of the whole zaliczka-v2 / tryb-mieszany arc as **actually shipped** (supersedes the typed-`C` slice-B checks above). Drive against the **5435 test DB**, OWNER/MANAGER, an investment with a seeded kosztorys + deposits.

### Podsumowanie tabs + money axis

- [ ] Podsumowanie renders as **tabs**; the panel money-axis toggle offers **Netto / Brutto / Mieszane**; a `Description` explains Mieszane ("częściowo netto, częściowo brutto").
- [ ] **Netto** vs **Brutto**: materiały (+ each category, Łącznie, Do zapłaty) differ by exactly the VAT (`brutto/(1+VAT)` vs raw); robocizna („Suma prac wykonanych") unchanged between axes.
- [ ] **Mieszane**: two stacked tables — netto section (Robocizna + Materiały = Łącznie − wpłaty netto → Do zapłaty netto) and faktura section (Reszta brutto − wpłaty brutto → Do zapłaty brutto). Rabat > 0 → trailing informational row. No crash when Do zapłaty goes negative (overpaid).
- [ ] **Materiały brutto→netto reduction**: the reduction-% control drives the netto materiały figure (default = VAT rate); Łącznie/Do zapłaty follow. Clearing/changing % recomputes live.

### Deposits + wpłaty base (⚠ the code-review WARNING fix — money-semantics)

- [ ] **Wpłaty tab / deposit list**: shows the investment's INVESTOR_DEPOSIT rows only; plane pie splits netto vs brutto (null⇒netto bucket).
- [ ] ⚠ **`wplatyNet` base fix — verify on an investment carrying a legacy `COMPANY_FUNDING` (or `OTHER_DEPOSIT`) row.** In **every** axis (Netto/Brutto/Mieszane), the „Wpłaty"/„Do zapłaty" figure must sum **only INVESTOR_DEPOSIT** — the legacy deposit must **not** inflate „Wpłaty". Before the fix the non-mixed axes folded it in (3 different totals per toggle); after, all surfaces agree. **This changes a client-facing figure on such investments — flagged for owner sign-off.** (Fresh COMPANY_FUNDING can't attach to an investment via the form per EX-557, so this only bites legacy/admin rows.) Regression-guarded by `src/__tests__/lib/db/get-deposit-transactions.test.ts`.

### Wydatki + Robocizna tabs

- [ ] **Wydatki tab**: per-category materiały breakdown table + expense pie; Σ === materiały brutto.
- [ ] **Robocizna tab**: per-etap „Suma transzy" table + Razem; the **„Postęp prac" bar** sits **below the table** with the caption „Ile zostało wykonane względem pierwotnych estymat z wyceny projektu" (no tooltip); percent can exceed 100% (bar caps, text shows the real overrun); hidden entirely when Przedmiar (plannedNet) ≤ 0.

### Deploy note (migration ordering — deploy-time, not a code check)

- [ ] **Both `20260721_*` migrations must be applied to preview/prod before/with this merge** — `20260721_0_drop_kosztorys_stage_from_transactions` then `20260721_1_add_vat_plane_to_transactions`. The `vat_plane` SELECT in `getDepositTransactionsForInvestment` **500s** if the code ships before the migration runs. Human-applied via `pnpm db:migrate:prod` (per AGENTS.md); order: migrate **before** the code that reads the column lands.

## remove-section-coeff — drop per-section coeff tier + explicit section sidebar buttons

**Driven 2026-07-24** — all 5 sidebar checks pass (OWNER `e2e@wykonczymy.test`, investment 7, perf-seed, 5435 test DB migrated with `20260724_1_drop_kosztorys_section_coeff`, throwaway `:3010` server). Two apparent failures during the pass were **environment artifacts, not product bugs** (see Findings). Removes the per-section subcontractor markup coeff (`wToolsCoeff`/`ownToolsCoeff` on `kosztorys_sections`) — `effectiveCoeff` collapses to global(investment)→per-item-override only — and replaces the icon-only sidebar actions with explicit labeled buttons.

### Findings — 2026-07-24

- [ ] **Deploy note (unchanged, human-owned):** `20260724_1_drop_kosztorys_section_coeff` still owes application to preview/prod via `pnpm db:migrate:prod` before the code lands there. Applied to the 5435 test DB during this pass (the dry-run) with no issue. **Needs human:** run the prod/preview migration at deploy time. **Test disposition:** no automated test — deploy-ordering step.

### Deploy note (migration ordering — deploy-time, not a code check)

- [ ] **`20260724_1_drop_kosztorys_section_coeff` must be applied to preview/prod with this merge.** Drops `w_tools_coeff` / `own_tools_coeff` from `kosztorys_sections` **only** (the investment-level columns of the same name stay). Human-applied via `pnpm db:migrate:prod`. **Ordering is reversed vs the usual "migrate before push" rule** — that rule is for column _adds_ (new code needs the column to exist). This is a _drop_: sections are read through the Payload ORM (`payload.find`), which builds its `SELECT` from the collection schema, so dropping the columns while old code (whose field defs still list them) is live would 500 on a missing column. Deploy the **code first** (its removed field defs stop selecting the columns), **then** run the migration to drop them. Kosztorys data is throwaway pre-dogfooding, so no backfill is owed.

## etap-tool-plane (EX-565) — per-etap rozliczenie plane + view-independent subcontractor settlement

**In review** — automated checks green (tsc, full unit suite, lint, webpack build; Turbopack build is blocked only by the worktree's symlinked `node_modules`). Manual boxes below **not yet driven**. Gives each etap a `plane` (z/bez narzędzi, `null` = defaulted-to-z-narzędziami + warned) and rebuilds „Podsumowanie podwykonawców" as ONE view-independent settlement — each etap valued at its own plane's price, split + razem, one shared wypłaty pool. Klient view + client share must stay byte-for-byte unchanged.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro — apply `20260724_2_add_plane_to_kosztorys_stages` there first, then seed a kosztorys into it; the dump carries none). Log in as **OWNER/MANAGER** (stage controls need MANAGEMENT_ROLES; `ADMIN`/`PASS` env is stale — mint a temp OWNER via the Local API script). Open an investment's **Kosztorys** tab with ≥1 section and etapy across both planes.

### Phase 1: Data layer

- [ ] After migration + dev-server **restart**, the kosztorys editor loads without query errors (lessons.md: verify the running app, restart pre-migration servers)
- [ ] Payload admin shows the plane select on a Kosztorys Stage

### Phase 2: Settlement math

- [ ] On a mixed-plane test kosztorys, „Suma wykonanej pracy" is identical in the Z and Bez views and equals the hand-computed per-plane sum

### Phase 3: Etap header UI

- [ ] Picking a plane updates the header icon instantly and survives a reload (persisted)
- [ ] A fresh etap shows the default wrench + `TriangleAlert`; picking z narzędziami explicitly clears the warning
- [ ] Client share page shows plain etap labels — no plane icons or warnings
- [ ] Selecting a plane does not disturb grid state (sort, filter, unsaved edits)

### Phase 4: Grid „nie dotyczy"

- [ ] In Bez narzędzi view, a z-narzędziami etap's value cells and footer read „nie dotyczy"; its qty cells still accept input
- [ ] A null-plane etap shows values in Z narzędziami view (it defaults there) and „nie dotyczy" in Bez narzędzi
- [ ] Klient view shows every etap's values as before
- [ ] No cell-remount symptoms while typing in qty cells (characters don't drop)

### Phase 5: Subcontractor summary

- [ ] Mixed-plane investment: Z and Bez views show the identical summary; split rows + razem reconcile with the grid's per-etap values
- [ ] „Pozostało do wypłaty" = razem − zaliczki, negative renders destructive as before
- [ ] Warning badge appears while any etap is unconfirmed and disappears once every plane is explicitly picked
- [ ] Single-plane investment (all z narzędziami, confirmed): summary matches the pre-change figure in the Z view

### Deploy note (migration ordering — deploy-time, not a code check)

- [ ] **`20260724_2_add_plane_to_kosztorys_stages` must be applied to preview/prod before/with this merge.** Adds nullable `plane` to `kosztorys_stages`. Standard column-**add** ordering (unlike the coeff drop above): migrate **before** the code that reads `plane` lands, or the SELECT 500s. Human-applied via `pnpm db:migrate:prod`. Kosztorys data is throwaway pre-dogfooding — no backfill; existing rows read `plane = null` (defaulted + warned), the intended cold-start state.
## EX-564 — kosztorys-percent-rabat-bulk-apply

**Awaiting manual verification.** All automated checks green (tsc 0, full unit suite 1117 pass, lint 0). No DB migration owed — `investments.globalDiscountType` is a plain `text` field, so narrowing the stored global discount to amount-only needs no schema change. Percent global rabat stops being stored state and becomes a one-shot bulk-apply into every per-item rabat; the stored global discount is now amount-only; subcontractor views are rabat-free.

Setup: run the app against the **5435 test DB** (see intro — seed a kosztorys into it first; the dump carries none). Log in as **OWNER/MANAGER**. Open an investment's **Kosztorys** tab → **Podsumowanie** tab (the „Rabat % na wszystkie pozycje" tool + „Rabat całościowy" select live in the settings bar there).

### Phase 0: Subcontractor views are rabat-free

- [ ] **Discount columns hidden in subcontractor views.** In **Klient** view the per-item rabat columns render; switch to **Z narzędziami** / **Bez narzędzi** → the rabat columns disappear entirely.
- [ ] **Subcontractor prices are gross of rabat.** A row carrying a per-item rabat prices at full net in the two subcontractor views (no rabat subtracted); the same row in Klient view shows the discounted net. Section subtotals and „Suma" match (subcontractor total ignores rabat).

### Phase 1: Percent bulk-apply tool

- [ ] **Apply 10% → every row shows 10% rabat; persists after reload.** Type `10` in „Rabat % na wszystkie pozycje" → „Zastosuj" → every item's rabat cell reads 10% (percent mode), totals drop accordingly, input clears. Reload → the per-item rabaty persist.
- [ ] **Overwrite check.** Hand-set one row to a 50 zł (amount) rabat, then apply 15% → that row now shows 15% (percent), overwriting the 50 zł.
- [ ] **Invalid input rejected.** `0`, a negative, `>100`, and non-numeric input leave „Zastosuj" disabled (nothing written).

### Phase 2: Amount-only stored discount

- [ ] **Settings offer only Kwota for the stored discount.** The „Rabat całościowy" select shows only **brak** / **zł** (no **%** option). Setting e.g. `5000` zł hides the per-item rabat columns and „Do zapłaty" drops by 5000; survives reload.
- [ ] **Version restore keeps the live amount discount.** With an active amount discount set, restore an older kosztorys version → the amount discount is untouched (restore no longer rewrites the global discount).
