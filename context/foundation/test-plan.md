## 1. Strategy

Tests follow three non-negotiable principles for this project:

1. **Cost × signal.** The cheapest test that gives a real signal for the
   risk wins. Do not promote to e2e because e2e "feels safer." Do not put a
   vision model on top of a deterministic diff that already catches the
   regression.
2. **User concerns are first-class evidence.** Risks anchored in "the team
   is worried about X, and the failure would surface somewhere in `<area>`"
   carry the same weight as PRD lines or hot-spot data.
3. **Risks are scenarios, not code locations.** This plan documents _what
   could fail_ and _why we believe it's likely_ — drawn from documents,
   interview, and codebase _signal_ (churn, structure, test base). It does
   NOT claim to know which line owns the failure. That knowledge is produced
   by `/10x-research` during each rollout phase. If the plan and research
   disagree about where the failure lives, research is the ground truth.

**Governing lesson (this project).** The team has already been burned by
tests that were green while the product was wrong: the investments _listing_
and the individual investment _view_ computed different numbers, and the
suite passed because the tests asserted the implementation, not the truth.
Therefore every test's **oracle must come from an independent source** —
product requirements or a second surface that must agree — never from the
code under test. An assertion whose expected value was lifted from the
implementation is tautological and is treated as a defect in the test.

Hot-spot scope used for likelihood weighting: `src/` (excluding
`payload-types`, `__tests__`, build output).

## 2. Risk Map

The top failure scenarios this project must protect against, ordered by
risk = impact × likelihood. Risks are failure scenarios in user / business
terms, not test names. The Source column cites the _evidence that surfaced
this risk_ — never a specific file as "where the failure lives" (that is
research's job, see §1 principle #3).

| #   | Risk (failure scenario)                                                                                                 | Impact | Likelihood | Source (evidence — not anchor)                                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Two app surfaces disagree — investment totals ≠ kosztorys totals (or listing ≠ detail view); numbers silently diverge   | High   | High       | interview Q1b, Q2 (lived burn); roadmap S-01 live-totals rule             |
| 2   | A form / mutation change breaks the user-facing path silently — no integration or e2e test exercises the real flow      | High   | High       | interview Q4 (layer gap); hot-spot dir `src/lib/actions` (38 commits/30d) |
| 3   | The core ledger drifts — a transfer stops correctly updating a register balance / marża / bilans                        | High   | Medium     | interview Q1a, Q3; roadmap FR-015 guardrail #1                            |

## 3. Phased Rollout

Each row is a discrete rollout phase that will open its own change folder
via `/10x-new`. Status moves left-to-right through the values below; the
orchestrator updates Status as artifacts appear on disk.

| #   | Phase name                          | Goal (one line)                                                                                  | Risks covered | Test types                   | Status        | Change folder                |

| 4   | Editor E2E coverage                 | User-facing editor paths (section/item, live totals, autosave, undo, view toggle) run in-browser | #2, #4        | e2e                          | not started   | —                            |
| 5   | Migration parity + scale gate       | Kosztorys figures match the sheet on a golden investment; transactions table holds at scale      | #5, #7        | contract/golden + perf smoke | not started   | —                            |

**Status vocabulary** (fixed): `not started` → `change opened` → `researched` → `planned` → `implementing` → `complete`.

## 5. Quality Gates

The full set of gates that must pass before a change reaches production.
"Required for §3 Phase N" means the gate is enforced once that rollout phase
lands; before that, the gate is `planned`.

| Gate                           | Where                     | Required?                         | Catches                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| lint + typecheck               | local + CI                | required                          | syntactic / type drift                            |
| unit + integration             | local + `.husky/pre-push` | required (pre-push runs tests)    | logic regressions                                 |
| e2e on critical flows          | local + CI on PR          | required after §3 Phase 1         | broken critical user paths (financial + editor)   |
| financial-core parity check    | local + CI                | required after §3 Phase 2         | cross-surface total divergence                    |
| dataset floor in `test:parity` | local + CI                | required after §3 Phase 2         | a fixture that lost a plane, silencing the guards |
| access-control on mutations    | local + CI                | required after §3 Phase 3         | role-bypass writes on kosztorys tables            |
| migration parity smoke         | manual, pre-cutover       | required before §3 Phase 5 (S-09) | in-app vs sheet number drift                      |

The dataset floor lives in `financial-golden-master-db.test.ts` — asserted as a test AND as a
precondition on the `UPDATE_GOLDEN` regenerate path, so a thinned fixture cannot be rebaselined
into looking healthy. `deposit-plane-sums.test.ts` guards the same coverage from the other side: it
compares the SQL fold against the TS fold on every investment and fails if the dataset holds no
wpłata brutto at all. Refill with the three-step `db-test` reset in `AGENTS.md`, never by lowering
the floor.

## 6. Cookbook Patterns

How to add new tests in this project. Each sub-section is filled in once the
relevant rollout phase ships; before that, it reads "TBD — see §3 Phase N."

### 6.1 Adding a unit test

- **Location**: `src/__tests__/`, mirroring the unit's feature area (e.g. `src/__tests__/leads/`).
- **Naming**: `<subject>.test.ts`; DB-backed variants use `<subject>.db.test.ts`.
- **Reference test**: `src/__tests__/calculate-margin.test.ts` (pure calc), `src/__tests__/leads/store-lead.db.test.ts` (DB-backed).
- **Run locally**: `pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/<file>.test.ts`.
- **Oracle rule**: expected values come from requirements or a hand-computed figure, never from the function under test (see §1 governing lesson).

### 6.2 Adding an integration test

- TBD — see §3 Phase 2. (Cross-surface parity + form→action→persisted-state patterns land here.)

### 6.3 Adding an e2e test

- TBD — see §3 Phase 1 (harness + auth fixture) and Phase 4 (editor flows).

### 6.4 Adding a test for a new server action / mutation

- TBD — see §3 Phase 2. Assert **persisted state**, not the `ActionResultT` return value (a success result can hide a failed write — AGENTS.md testing rule).

### 6.5 Adding an access-control test

- TBD — see §3 Phase 3. Call the action as each role; assert server-side allow/deny, not UI visibility.

### 6.6 Per-rollout-phase notes

(Optional. After each phase lands, the implementing plan appends a 2-3 line
note here capturing anything surprising the phase taught.)

## 7. What We Deliberately Don't Test

Exclusions agreed during the rollout (Phase 2 interview, Q5). Future
contributors should respect these unless the underlying assumption changes.

- **Google Sheets sync / mirror** — retired at cutover (roadmap S-09). Don't invest in testing the dying integration beyond the one-time parity oracle in Phase 5 and not corrupting live data before then. Re-evaluate only if cutover is cancelled. (Source: Phase 2 interview Q5.)
- **Caching / revalidation correctness** — the team is explicitly not worried about caching. Re-evaluate if a stale-data incident surfaces. (Source: interview Q3, Q5.)
- **UI snapshot / visual-regression tests** — brittle, catch little on this app's screens. Re-evaluate if a purely-visual regression class emerges. (Source: interview Q5.)
- **Payload admin panel** — framework-owned, low blast radius, not our code. (Source: interview Q5.)
- **Neon prod data-loss via branch retention** — real, but a backup/observability concern, not a test target (tracked in memory + `lesson-db-backup-resilience`). Handled by the FTP backup pipeline, not this rollout.
