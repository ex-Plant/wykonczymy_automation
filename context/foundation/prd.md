# Wykonczymy — off-sheets phase 1

## Current System Overview

wykonczymy is a business-management dashboard for a finishing/renovation business:
cash registers, transfers, investments, and employees. Polish UI, English code.
Architecture: a Next.js App Router application backed by Payload CMS over Postgres,
with role-based access (ADMIN / OWNER / MANAGER / EMPLOYEE).

The **kosztorys** — the per-investment line-item budget (items, sections, stage
progress, per-room measurements, and a summary) — does **not** live in the app
today. It lives in Google Sheets, six tabs per investment. The app owns exactly
one tab per sheet (`wydatki inwestycyjne (tylko do odczytu)`): a one-way
materialised mirror that pushes each active `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` row into the sheet
so the owner sees actuals next to the plan. Postgres is the source of truth for
that one tab; everything else on the sheet is hand-edited "sheet land" the app
never reads. A manual **Synchronizuj** button heals drift. This mirror is
explicitly transitional — a bridge between "the plan lives in Sheets" and "the
actuals live in the app."

Verification today is split: Vitest unit specs under `src/__tests__` are automated,
but **end-to-end verification is manual** — an operator drives Playwright through
an MCP session against the dev server and reads sheets back through the API.
Nothing E2E is automated or CI-runnable.

Prior design work this PRD builds on:

- `context/changes/kosztorys-poc-in-app/change.md` (on branch `poc-kosztorys-in-app`) —
  the POC decision register that superseded the deleted 2026-05-28 design draft: its
  D1–D13 decisions and draft data shape were resolved and built in the POC.
- `context/reference/kosztorys-sync.md` — the current mirror's authoritative behaviour.

## Problem Statement & Motivation

Two pains drive this change.

**Pain 1 (primary, owner-felt).** The owner works across two worlds: Google Sheets
for the kosztorys plan, the app for actuals. Keeping them agreeing is "a crazy
pain" — stale mirrors, manual reconciliation, and drift that a button has to heal.
The work currently in flight (fitting the sheets with app data) is explicitly a
temporary patch. The permanent fix is to make every kosztorys capability executable
inside the app, with no sheet↔app syncing at all.

**Pain 2 (operator-felt, and a gate on Pain 1).** End-to-end coverage exists only
as manual Playwright-MCP sessions. Every change to a financially sensitive flow
needs a hand-driven verification pass, and nothing protects against regressions
automatically. This gap also makes the migration itself risky: cutting the
kosztorys over without automated end-to-end checks on the financial core is
high-risk.

This PRD is **phase 1 of the off-sheets arc**: full in-app parity for new
investments plus (as a second, later release within the same arc) an importer for
existing investments' sheet data. Removing the mirror/Google integration entirely
(Phase 3b in the design spec) is a separate future change, triggered only once
cutover is proven.

## User & Persona

**Primary — the owner** (the client running the finishing business). Non-technical.
Today they live in Google Sheets for kosztorys work and in the app for cash/transfer
operations. Their moment of pain: planning or updating a kosztorys and needing the
numbers to agree with the app's actuals — currently mediated by a fragile one-way
mirror and manual habit. After this change, a new investment's kosztorys is authored
entirely in the app; the two-worlds split disappears for new work.

### Secondary persona

**The operator/maintainer.** Pays the maintenance cost of the Google API bridge and
performs all E2E verification by hand. Their experience changes via workstream A:
automated, CI-runnable E2E replaces hand-driven MCP sessions for the financial core.

## Success Criteria

### Primary

- A newly created investment's kosztorys lives **only in the app**, and the owner
  runs its full lifecycle there — sections, items, three price models, stage
  progress (etapy), rooms (pokoje), totals, and print/PDF — with no Google Sheet
  created and no syncing involved.
- End-to-end verification of the financial core (sign in → create a transfer →
  register balance and investment figures update) runs automated and CI-runnable,
  replacing manual operator-driven sessions for that flow.

### Secondary

- Authoring a kosztorys in the app is subjectively faster for the owner than it
  was in Sheets.

### Guardrails

- **Financial integrity preserved.** Transfers, register balances, and marża/bilans
  figures stay correct; kosztorys work must not touch these write paths.
- **Live sheet data preserved.** Existing kosztorys sheet data (the live jobs)
  survives untouched until it is safely imported in the later release.
- **Mirror keeps working.** The materiały-mirror keeps syncing for every investment
  still on sheets throughout the transition.

## User Stories

### US-01: Owner runs a new investment's kosztorys fully in-app

- **Given** the parity release has shipped and a Manager-or-above user creates a new
  investment
- **When** they open that investment's kosztorys
- **Then** they author it entirely in the app — sections, items with three price
  models, stage progress, rooms, and live totals — and no Google Sheet exists for
  this investment
- _(Before: a sheet was provisioned or linked per investment and the kosztorys lived
  there, bridged by a one-way mirror.)_

#### Acceptance Criteria

- No sheet-backed kosztorys record is created for the new investment.
- All four parity surfaces work: etapy, pokoje, print/PDF + CSV, catalogue
  autocomplete.
- Totals (row / section / grand) match hand-computed values.

### US-02: Financial core is regression-protected automatically

- **Given** the automated E2E suite is installed and CI-runnable
- **When** a developer pushes a change touching transfers
- **Then** the suite signs in, creates a transfer, and asserts the register balance
  and investment figures update — with no operator-driven manual session
- _(Before: E2E verification was a hand-driven Playwright-MCP session per change.)_

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Runs against an isolated test database, never the real local data.
- Goes red on a balance-calculation regression; a green run requires no human
  interaction.

## Scope of Change

Each item carries its FR id and (where one was recorded during shaping) the
strongest counter-argument considered and its resolution. All sixteen requirements
were challenged and resolved as "stands as written."

### New — kosztorys in-app (workstream B)

- **[new] FR-001** — Manager+ can create, rename, reorder, and delete kosztorys
  sections for an investment.
  > Considered: "sections could be a plain item label / catalogue-owned grouping."
  > Stands — per-investment, renameable, orderable sections are core to how the
  > owner organizes a kosztorys.
- **[new] FR-002** — Manager+ can add, inline-edit, reorder, and delete kosztorys
  items (description, unit, planned qty, measured qty, note).
  > Considered: "dialog-form editing is cheaper than spreadsheet-style inline
  > cells." Stands — inline editing is the parity bar; the owner is replacing a
  > spreadsheet.
- **[new] FR-003** — Manager+ can record three price models per item and toggle the
  pricing view (klient / podwykonawca z narzędziami / własne narzędzia).
  > Considered: "only one model may be used in practice / per-item mixing may be
  > needed." Stands — inspection confirmed all three carry real data.
- **[new] FR-004** — Manager+ can manage variable-count stages (etapy) and record
  per-item, per-stage progress.
  > Considered: "fixed 10 columns is simpler / progress could be a later feature."
  > Stands — etapy are how the owner tracks a job; parity without them is not parity.
- **[new] FR-005** — Manager+ can manage rooms (pokoje) measurements per investment.
  > Considered: "real usage doubted; could be a calculator inside the item form."
  > Stands — the owner uses pokoje; it is part of the parity bar.
- **[new] FR-006** — Manager+ can maintain a work catalogue and add items via
  autocomplete (hand-typing always allowed).
  > Considered: "an empty catalogue is dead weight until seeded; could grow
  > organically from typed items." Stands — the master price list is required at
  > release.
  > **CUT (2026-07-28, owner).** The catalogue half shipped as szablony
  > (`kosztorys_presets`, S-09); the autocomplete half never will — superseded by
  > „Dodaj sekcję z szablonu" (EX-503), which composes from existing prace at
  > section granularity. See roadmap → Cut & folded slices.
- **[new] FR-007** — Owner sees per-row, per-section, and grand totals computed
  live.
  > Considered: "scale risk at 1000+ rows; server-computed totals safer." Stands —
  > live totals are table-stakes for replacing a spreadsheet.
- **[new] FR-010** — Owner can import an existing sheet kosztorys into the app
  (delivered in the second release, after the parity release).
  > Considered: "'later' becomes never without a trigger; manual retyping may be
  > cheaper than a parser." Stands — a second-release importer is the right risk
  > ordering. _(Trigger/timing is an open question — see Open Questions.)_

### New — test automation (workstream A)

- **[new] FR-011** — Developer/CI can run an automated end-to-end suite (no
  operator-driven MCP sessions).
  > Considered: "the real cost is test-data isolation + auth fixtures; flakiness
  > tax." Stands — manual verification doesn't scale and gates the migration.
- **[new] FR-012** — The financial-core smoke (sign in → create transfer → register
  balance + investment figures update) runs automated.
  > Considered: "transfer side effects make it slow/flaky; the editor might deserve
  > the first test instead." Stands — financial integrity is guardrail #1.
- **[new] FR-013** — Kosztorys editor flows are end-to-end-covered before the
  owner-facing release.
  > Considered: "gate on critical paths only / one manual pass is cheaper." Stands —
  > the owner gets the editor only when it is verified; that is the point of
  > workstream A.

### Modified

- **[modified] FR-008** — Owner can print/PDF and CSV-export the kosztorys. _(Was:
  print/PDF and CSV export exist for transfers only.)_ Reuses the existing export
  infrastructure; only the kosztorys-shaped render is new.
  > Considered: "the client-facing doc may need design beyond browser print; the CSV
  > shape for nested data is its own decision." Stands — reuse is why this is cheap;
  > polish later if needed.
- **[modified] FR-009** — New investments get no Google Sheet; their kosztorys exists
  only in the app, nothing synced. _(Was: each new investment provisioned or linked
  a sheet.)_
  > Considered: "needs an explicit activation moment; the owner may want an escape
  > hatch." Stands — a lingering sheet option recreates the two-worlds problem.

### Preserved (must not break)

- **[preserved] FR-014** — The materiały-mirror keeps syncing for investments still
  on sheets.
  > Considered: "freeze it entirely / mark it deprecated from release day." Stands —
  > preserved as-is until teardown.
- **[preserved] FR-015** — Transfers, register balances, and marża/bilans
  computations behave identically.
  > Considered: "make the read/write boundary explicit for future plan-vs-actual
  > joins." Stands as written.
- **[preserved] FR-016** — Existing sheet kosztorysy stay accessible (their current
  view) until imported.
  > Considered: "two-worlds confusion returns; the old sheets could go read-only
  > post-release." Stands — old investments keep their full sheet workflow until
  > imported; the transition period is accepted.

### Removed

None in this change. The mirror/Google integration teardown is explicitly deferred
(see Non-Goals).

## Constraints & Compatibility

- **Additive schema only.** New kosztorys tables are added; no existing table is
  altered and no migration of current records is needed at the parity release. The
  importer (second release) reads sheets and writes only the new tables.
- **Mirror untouched.** The one-way actuals mirror (and the Payload collection hooks
  that drive it) must keep working unchanged for investments still on sheets.
- **Financial write paths off-limits.** Transfers, balance-recalculation hooks, and
  marża/bilans calculations are not modified by this change. Future plan-vs-actual
  views may read investment-expense data but never write it.
- **Live sheet data survives.** Existing sheet kosztorysy keep their full current
  workflow until imported; their data must survive untouched.
- **Auth and roles preserved.** The authentication model and role boundaries are
  unchanged (see Access Control Changes).
- **Test isolation.** Automated tests must leave no trace in the real local data and
  must never write through live Google credentials.

## Business Logic Changes

**New rule (added):** a kosztorys item's worth is computed, never stored —
**quantity × its snapshotted price.** Prices are copied from the catalogue at the
moment an item is created and do not change retroactively; all totals (row, section,
stage, grand) are derived from that rule rather than persisted.

The rule consumes the quantities the user enters (planned, measured, per-stage done)
and the per-item price under the selected pricing view. Its output is the live
row/section/grand totals the owner sees while editing and in the printed/exported
document. A later change to a catalogue master price affects only items created
afterwards — existing kosztorysy are immutable to it.

**Existing rules unchanged:** marża = robocizna − wypłaty − rabat − strata, the
bilans computation, and register-balance recalculation on transfer create/delete.

Workstream A (test automation) is infrastructure-only: **no domain-logic change.**

## Access Control Changes

**No access-control changes — current model preserved.** Authentication and the four
roles (ADMIN / OWNER / MANAGER / EMPLOYEE) are unchanged.

The new in-app kosztorys editor — including per-item client prices and both
subcontractor price models — is gated exactly like today's kosztorys surfaces:
ADMIN, OWNER, and MANAGER. There is no view/edit split. EMPLOYEE has no kosztorys
access, unchanged.

## Non-Goals

- **No real-time collaborative editing, no multi-currency (PLN only), no
  multi-tenant catalogues** — confirmed out of scope.
- **No mirror/Google teardown in this change** — removing the integration is a later
  change, triggered only after cutover is proven.
- **No bidirectional sheet↔app sync** — the editor never reads from or writes to
  sheets (the one-shot importer is the only exception).
- **No schema-level customization** — no per-investment custom columns or
  arbitrary-field sidecars; a free-text note field covers ad-hoc needs.

## Open Questions

Resolved during shaping (recorded here for traceability): currency is PLN-only
(non-goal); rooms/pokoje are in scope (FR-005); the catalogue is a single shared
list (no multi-tenant). The following were surfaced by the design spec or by shaping
and remain open — they are load-bearing for implementation, not invented gaps.

1. **Per-item discount (rabat).** The sheet has a per-item discount column. Keep it
   as a per-item field, derive it from a catalogue default, or handle it elsewhere?
   — Owner: user. Ref: spec Q1.
2. **VAT.** The sheet appears net-only. Does the in-app kosztorys need a per-item VAT
   rate, a single net model, or net plus a global gross flag? Matters if the
   kosztorys is the formal client offer. — Owner: user. Ref: spec Q2.
3. **Labour vs. materials shape.** Are labour items and materials one unified item
   list with a kind flag, or separate lists? This also affects whether the
   materiały-mirror can retire sooner. — Owner: user. Ref: spec Q3.
4. **Delete semantics for kosztorys items.** Soft-delete (audit trail) or hard-delete
   (simpler, matches the rest of the app)? — Owner: user. Ref: spec Q4.
5. **Ordering of sections / items / stages.** Drag-to-reorder or by-creation /
   alphabetical? FR-001 and FR-002 assume reorder; confirm the interaction cost is
   accepted. — Owner: user. Ref: spec Q6.
6. ~~**Catalogue seeding.**~~ **Resolved (2026-07-09), then moot (2026-07-28):** no
   standalone catalogue — szablony are the master price list, so building szablony is
   seeding, and the autocomplete that would have read them is cut.
7. **Item-to-room link.** Some items are room-scoped, some global. Does an item carry
   an optional room link in this phase, or is that deferred? — Owner: user. Ref:
   spec Q10.
8. **Importer trigger (FR-010).** What concretely triggers the second-release
   importer, so "later" does not become "never"? Name a condition or date. — Owner:
   user.
