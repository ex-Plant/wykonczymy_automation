# Domain Glossary — Wykonczymy

One concept per row, in **three registers**: what the **owner sees** (Polish UI / the sheet's name)
and what the **code calls it** (English identifier). It does two jobs at once:

- **Translation** (left columns) — "what is what in code vs the app", so the agent can translate the
  owner's Polish silently and reliably, per AGENTS.md's `Polish UI, English code` mandate.
- **Naming map** (right columns) — the **canonical** code identifier per concept, plus the **drift
  variants** that must converge on it. This is the rename spec **EX-548** executes against.

This is the **register** (a descriptive snapshot with proposed canonicals), not yet the completed
rename. A row's drift is real until its `Drift in code` cell is empty. The renames are tracked work
(EX-548 + a follow-up whole-app sweep), **not** implied done by listing them here.

## How to read a row

| Column                | Meaning                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept**           | The business figure/thing — the stable key.                                                                                                     |
| **App/UI (PL)**       | The Polish label the owner sees, or says.                                                                                                       |
| **Sheet name**        | The owner's sheet vocabulary (kosztorys rows only; the sheet is domain authority).                                                              |
| **Canonical code id** | The **one** English identifier code should use. Matches the transfers side.                                                                     |
| **Cat**               | **A** = sheet proper noun, Polish allowed as ubiquitous language · **B** = generic figure, English required · **A?** = gray zone, owner's call. |
| **Drift in code**     | Non-canonical identifiers currently in code. Empty = already clean.                                                                             |
| **Lives in**          | Where the concept is derived/defined (`file:line` or slice id).                                                                                 |

Diacritics are the tell: a **code identifier** has none (`marza`), Polish **prose/UI** does (`Marża`).

**Category A is exactly three concepts:** `kosztorys`, `przedmiar`, `pomiar`. The test is **"no clean
English equivalent"**, not "the sheet says it in Polish" — the sheet also says „etapy" and
„robocizna", and those are `stage` / `laborCosts` in code. Anything not on that list of three is
Category B, whatever the sheet calls it.

## 1. Financial core — cash ledger + investment P&L (whole app)

The mature, code-enforced domain. Canonicals already match transfers/`lib/db` for most rows; the
drift is where kosztorys code re-typed the same figure in Polish.

**Robocizna — ruled `laborCosts` (owner, 2026-07-20).** The transfers side already owned an English
form (`LABOR_COST`, `totalLaborCosts`), and a figure may not carry two names across the recon seam,
so the English form wins over the sheet-noun defense. The `robocizna` key on both the reconciliation
verdict and the summary split → `laborCosts`; the two recon operands take the plane suffixes below.
Polish stays in UI labels („Robocizna",
„Transakcje robocizny", „Wliczone w robociznę") and in prose comments naming the domain concept.

**`bilans` / `marza` — ruled `balance` / `margin` (owner, 2026-07-20).** Common words, no proper-noun
claim ("nothing special about them"). Verified **symbol-only**: local vars + the `{ bilans, marza }`
delta shape in two test/script files + one `print-button.tsx` local — **no** SQL column, Payload field,
or migration column carries these names (the canonical functions are already `calculateBalance` /
`calculateMargin`), so the rename touches **no columns**. Prose („bilans inwestora" tooltips) stays.

**`rabat` — ruled `discount` (owner, 2026-07-20).** Same shape as the others: `discount` is a clean
equivalent and `RABAT` / `totalRabat` already exist on the transfers side. The lowercase Polish code
forms → `discount*` (`rabat` → `discount`, `rabatNet` → `discountNet`, `rabatAmount` → `discountAmount`).
`rabatClientNet` is the one exception — it is a **recon operand**, so it takes a plane suffix
(`discountNetFromKosztorys`) rather than the bare form the 2026-07-20 note proposed; see the plane-suffix
section below. The **uppercase `RABAT`** transfer-type enum value **stays** — it's the canonical DB enum
constant, not drift. Polish stays in UI labels („rabat %", „Rabat").

**`saldo` — ruled `registerBalance` (owner, 2026-08-15).** Polish `saldo` and `bilans` both translate
to `balance`, so translating them naively would create the very collision this glossary exists to
prevent. `balance` stays with the **investment** figure, which already owns the name in code
(`calculateBalance`) and in a DB column; the cash-register family takes the `register*` prefix. The
inverse choice would have renamed a correct name and split code from schema. The default string
`label = 'Saldo'` stays.

### Plane suffixes — the exception to "one concept, one name"

Two figures can be the **same concept on different planes** and still be **different values by
design**. The recon seam is built to scream when they disagree (`buildKosztorysReconciliation`), so
collapsing them onto one bare name destroys the distinction the alarm rests on.

**The rule (owner, 2026-07-20): keep the canonical base name identical on both sides, and append
`FromKosztorys` / `FromTransactions`.** The shared prefix is what makes the pair legible as one
concept; the suffix is the only thing that differs, so a reader can't mistake which side they hold.

| Concept      | kosztorys plane              | transactions plane                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| labor charge | `laborCostsNetFromKosztorys` | `laborCostsNetFromTransactions` (Σ `LABOR_COST`) |
| discount     | `discountNetFromKosztorys`   | `discountNetFromTransactions` (Σ `RABAT`)        |

**These two pairs are the whole list** (verified 2026-08-15 at `reconciliation.ts:120-121`, which
compares exactly two figures). Anything else is one-plane and stays bare.

**A figure that exists on only one plane stays bare** (owner, 2026-07-20) — `depositsByStage`, not
`depositsByStageFromKosztorys`. The suffix is a warning that a twin exists; hanging it on everything
turns it into noise that stops warning. Add it when the second plane appears, not before.

`totalLaborCosts` on `investment-financials` keeps its name for the same reason — it's the ledger
aggregate at its own source, not a recon operand. The suffix applies where the two meet.

Two prior passes got this wrong: `robociznaNet` → `laborCostsNet` fixed the language but dropped the
plane; `laborFromKosztorysNet` carried the plane but mangled the base name, so the pair no longer
shared a prefix. **A language ruling does not settle the plane question — check this section before
renaming anything the reconciliation compares.**

**A type can carry the plane instead of the name (owner, 2026-08-15).** `SummaryReadingT`
(`summary-reading.ts:14`) is a plane-selection wrapper: two producers build it, one per plane, and
every consumer holds exactly one. Its fields therefore stay **bare** — `discountAmount`, not
`discountAmountFromKosztorys` — because the type already answers the question the suffix would
answer, and a suffix hung where it adds nothing is the noise this section warns about. The rule
generalises: **suffix the figure only where both planes are in scope at the same time**, which in
practice means the two operand pairs above and nothing else.

Same reasoning closes the subcontractor figures: `remaining` and `dueNet`
(`subcontractor-summary.ts:138`) exist on one plane only and stay bare.

**`stage deposit` / `zaliczki` — retired (EX-536).** The deposit→etap tagging bridge is gone:
`lib/kosztorys/zaliczki.ts` deleted, the `kosztorys_stage_id` column dropped from `transactions`
(migration `20260721_0`), and `zaliczkiByStage` removed from the editor data. Deposits are no longer
tagged to a stage — the concept has no code referent to name. (It was EX-548's canonical worst-offender
example: `Zaliczka*` exports importing `isDepositType`; the example is retired with the code.)

**`etap` — ruled `stage` (2026-07-20), NOT a proper noun.** It was listed `A` on the "the sheet says
etapy" reflex, but `stage` is already the code's dominant word (`stage*` outnumbers `etap`-identifiers
~15:1 — `stageId`, `kosztorysStage`, the `stage-progress` collection). A concept with a clean English
equivalent already in use fails the Category-A test, whatever the sheet calls it. Rename landed (EX-536):
`KosztorysEtapTotals` / `kosztorys-etap-totals.tsx` → `KosztorysStageTotals` / `kosztorys-stage-totals.tsx`,
and the `orphaned-etap-tag` test file was deleted with the bridge. Polish stays in UI labels („Usuń etap",
„Bez etapu") and prose.

**`podsumowanie` — ruled `summary` (2026-07-20), NOT a proper noun.** Same test as `etap`: naming the
sheet's specific „Podsumowanie" block is not enough when `summary` is a clean English equivalent.
Renamed: `computePodsumowanie` → `computeSummary`, `PodsumowanieT` → `SummaryT`,
`KosztorysPodsumowanie` → `KosztorysSummary`, `kosztorys-podsumowanie.tsx` → `kosztorys-summary.tsx`.

**`lacznie` — ruled `combined` (2026-07-20).** Not `total`: `totalNet` already denotes the _executed_
total in `use-kosztorys-editor.ts`, and „Łącznie" is the Robocizna+Materiały combination — a different
figure. `combined` / `combinedNet` keeps them distinguishable. This row was missing from the glossary
entirely; it surfaced only because `computeSummary` returned a half-renamed `{ laborCosts, lacznie }`.

**`sumaPrac` / pre-rabat robocizna — ruled `laborCostsNetPreDiscount` (owner, 2026-08-15), with one
operation split off.** Three code paths produced this figure: `sumaPracPreRabat(laborCostsNet,
rabatAmount)`, the `sumaPracNet` field, and `executedWorkNetPreRabat(subtotals)`. On the **client
view** all three yield the same złoty. They are **not** interchangeable elsewhere:
`executedWorkNetPreRabat` is view-agnostic and deliberately omits the global-discount add-back,
because the crew is owed its price regardless of a concession made to the client. One name over both
would assert an equality that is false on `w_tools` / `no_tools`.

So the unification is one name per **figure** plus a separate name for the **operation**:
`laborCostsNetPreDiscount(laborCostsNet, discountAmount)` is the figure;
`sumSectionSubtotalsNet(subtotals)` is a sum over sections and says so. Composing them keeps the
parity oracle honest on every view.

### Kosztorys settlement panel — canonical names (2026-08-15)

| Concept                  | App/UI (PL)          | Canonical code id                           | Drift renamed from                            |

| amount still owed        | Pozostało do zapłaty | `amountDue` (`computeAmountDue`)            | `doZaplaty*`, `computeDoZaplatyRM`            |
| outstanding net          | Do rozliczenia       | `outstandingNet`                            | `doRozliczeniaNet`                            |
| cash remainder           | Reszta               | `remainderGross`                            | `resztaGross`                                 |
| executed value           | Wykonane             | `executedNet`                               | `wykonaneNet`                                 |
| labor charge (billed)    | Robocizna            | `laborCostsNet`                             | `robocizna` (field)                           |
| materials (billed)       | Materiały            | `materialsBilled`                           | `materialy` (field)                           |
| expense dataset          | Wydatki              | `ExpenseDatasetT`, `partitionExpenseRows`   | `WydatkiDatasetT`, `partitionWydatkiRows`     |
| labor tab (sheet import) | zakładka robocizny   | `laborGrid`, `parseLaborTab`, `laborTabGid` | `robocizna`, `parseRobocizna`, `robociznaGid` |
| pie-chart base           | Przedmiar/Wykonane   | `SectionPieBaseT = 'planned' \| 'executed'` | `'przedmiar' \| 'wykonane'`                   |

`SectionPieBaseT` is worth calling out: it is a **string union**, and the `local/no-domain-drift`
guard matches `Identifier` nodes only, so a Polish union value is invisible to it. This one was found
by reading, not by the rule, and the next one will be too.

## 3. DB-column guardrail

Canonical identifiers that map to a **real shared Postgres column** on prod data (`balance`, `margin`
on transfers/investments) — a **symbol** rename is safe; a **column** rename is a separate, careful
step and is **out of scope** until explicitly decided. Kosztorys columns are throwaway pre-dogfooding
(AGENTS.md) so their renames carry no data cost.

**Polish string values that are frozen by a migration** — these look like drift and are not; renaming
either one is a schema change, so both stay until someone decides otherwise:

| Value         | Where it is frozen                                                             | Also appears as                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'RABAT'`     | `enum_transactions_type` (`src/migrations/20260611_add_rabat_enum.ts:7`)       | a URL query-filter value in `transfer-filters.tsx`; key in `constants/transfers.ts:146` |
| `'planowana'` | `InvestmentStatusT` (`src/types/reference-data.ts:15`), migration `20260718_0` | investment status filters                                                               |

**Verified clean (2026-08-15):** no identifier in the EX-548 drift inventory is a DB column, a Payload
field, or a key inside persisted JSON. In particular `rabat_client_net` / `suma_prac_net` /
`global_rabat_net` (`src/lib/db/kosztorys-client-totals.ts:86-88`) are **SQL aliases, not columns** —
free to rename. The newest persisted surface, `kosztoryses.sheet_column_mapping`, already uses English
keys (`ColumnFieldT`, `sheet-import/columns.ts:36-43`).
