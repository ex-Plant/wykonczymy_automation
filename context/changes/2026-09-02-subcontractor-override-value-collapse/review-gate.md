# Review-gate ledger — subcontractor-override-value-collapse (EX-766) · 2026-09-02

Diff scope: `d4db3506..HEAD` (b5760821, 0ecb242c, 562ddbe1, c2cbeba8, d01a3c73) — 80 files.

Fan-out: `/10x-impl-review`, `/code-review`, `feature-first-structure`, `module-cohesion-audit`,
`structure-scatter-audit`, `comment-noise-audit`.
Dropped: `tailwind-v4-audit` — the slice changes zero `className`s (verified, not assumed).
Step 0.5 (browser verification) skipped — this slice's manual checks need a deployed staging behind
the preview migration, which does not exist yet.

Step 2 (`/simplify`) not dispatched as a separate pass: three of the six checks above already swept
the diff for reuse/simplification and converged on the same four findings, all applied below. A
second mutating agent over the same 80 files would re-derive what is already fixed.

## Findings

- [x] 🔴 CRITICAL · dismissed · `code-review` · `src/migrations/20260902_0_collapse_kosztorys_tool_overrides.ts:20` · The migration fuses an additive half (backfill) with a destructive one (`DROP COLUMN`) and declares only the destructive order, so between deploy and apply every „auto" praca reads as an explicit 0 zł — mechanism confirmed (2020 + 2204 auto planes on the prod dump), blast radius nil: no kosztorys has been issued to a client, nobody reads preview, and the owner applies the migration in the same sitting. Already an owner decision recorded in `change.md:44-47`. I split the migration and then reverted it on the owner's ruling; the header now states the fusion and its expiry condition instead of misdeclaring one order.
      test: no automated test · manual — a deploy-sequencing property, not a code path
- [x] 🔴 CRITICAL · fixed · `impl-review` + `code-review` · `src/migrations/20260902_0_collapse_kosztorys_tool_overrides.ts:48` · Legacy `manual` snapshots were spared on an audit ("all 11 are empty"), but `replaceTreeWithSnapshot` writes a `manual` of the current tree before every preset load and sheet import — a non-empty one can appear between the audit and the apply, and restores „auto" as an explicit 0 zł. The `DELETE` now carries a predicate (`kind = 'auto' OR jsonb_array_length(payload->'items') > 0`), so the guarantee is the SQL rather than a point-in-time count that had already drifted 11→13.
      test: no automated test · integration — a fixture of a stored old-shape payload would assert the same thing the predicate makes unreachable; closing it in SQL is cheaper and stronger
- [x] 🟡 WARNING · dismissed · `code-review` · `src/lib/kosztorys/snapshot-format.ts:29` · `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION` not bumped for a non-additive payload change. Its own rule offers three exits and this change takes _delete_ — which the predicate above now completes: after `up`, no surviving payload carries a pozycja written in the old shape. Bumping on top would strand nothing and gain nothing.
- [x] 🟡 WARNING · fixed · `code-review` · `src/lib/kosztorys/snapshot-format.ts:21` · The rule text instructs „migrate presets, deleting destroys real work" while this migration deletes them. The decision is the owner's and stands; the rule now carries the override clause, because this file is what the next column-move reads.
- [x] ⚠️ WARNING · fixed · `impl-review` · `context/foundation/manual-checks.md:3684` · Three Phase 2 manual checks were lost when the plan's items were aggregated into the registry (sheet-import blank stawka, Ctrl+Z over a source change, `/admin` save of an unrelated field). Restored.
- [x] ⚠️ WARNING · dismissed · `impl-review` · `src/migrations/index.ts:83` · Registering `20260901_1_work_catalogue_auto_rates` alongside the collapse piggybacks a second migration into the prod apply. Registering it is the fix, not the defect — prod has been throwing 23502 on a katalog „auto" write since 2026-09-01 because it was never in the array. The conflicting-headers concern folds into the first finding and dies with it.
- [x] 🔵 OBSERVATION · fixed · `code-review` + `impl-review` · `src/migrations/20260902_0_collapse_kosztorys_tool_overrides.ts:51` · `down()` claimed „every row comes back to the exact value it held" — true of the value, false of the type (a legacy `'coeff'` string is unrecoverable). Comment now says what the SQL delivers.
- [x] 🔵 OBSERVATION · dismissed · `code-review` · `src/__tests__/financial-golden-master-db.test.ts:185` · The legacy-byte rewrite is exact for `NULL` and `'amount'`, not for a legacy `'coeff'` row. Fails loud (a red parity test on an investment whose money did not move), never silent — and parity is green on the unregenerated fixture, so no such row is in the twelve comparable investments.
- [x] 🔵 OBSERVATION · dismissed · `impl-review` · `test.js:284` + 3 legal pages · `pnpm lint` fails on 4 errors. All pre-existing, all outside the diff.
- [x] fixed · `module-cohesion-audit` + `code-review` · `src/lib/db/work-catalogue.ts:124` · `numOrNull` hand-rolled a second time in a sibling of the module that already had it. Promoted to `src/lib/db/row-coerce.ts`; both mappers import it. This is where a third hand-roll would have let `?? 0` back in, which is the one mistake EX-766 exists to prevent.
- [x] fixed · `code-review` · `src/lib/kosztorys/calc.ts:78` · `overrideValueFor`'s ternary spelled the plane→field mapping that `OVERRIDE_FIELDS` already holds. It now reads through the constant, so the mapping has one home.
- [x] fixed · `code-review` · `src/lib/kosztorys/subcontractor-price-edit.ts:15` · `withOverride`'s `as RowT` papered over a computed-key spread that lost its type. Typing `OVERRIDE_FIELDS` as literal keys (`as const satisfies`) narrows it enough; the cast is gone and `tsc` is green.
- [x] dropped · `code-review` · `src/components/kosztorys/editor/grid/cells/subcontractor-columns.tsx:17` · `FIXED_MODE = 'amount'` keeps a token whose column no longer exists. Real, but it is a private UI option value with one reader — renaming it buys a grep result and risks the specs that drive the picker.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/lib/kosztorys/calc.ts:102` · Doc-line restated its own three-line body. Deleted.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/scripts/perf-seed-kosztorys.ts:82` · Comment restated the ternary beneath it **and was in Polish**, which AGENTS.md forbids for code comments. Deleted.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/__tests__/lib/kosztorys/subcontractor-price-edit.test.ts:94` · Comment restated `const entry = 70`. Deleted.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/lib/kosztorys/constants.ts:3` · Sentence 1 restated the `Record` type; the surviving line now carries the reason plus why the type is literal.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/components/kosztorys/editor/grid/cells/subcontractor-columns.tsx:27` · Sentence 1 was the ternary beneath it. Trimmed.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/lib/kosztorys/snapshot-format.ts:94` · The block reopened with what lines 66-67 already said. Trimmed to the `sql`-tag mechanism, which is the part nothing else states.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/lib/kosztorys/subcontractor-price-edit.ts:8` · First sentence restated the signature. Trimmed.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/__tests__/lib/kosztorys/row-conditions.test.ts:289` · Vanished-state „now" framing. Rewritten in the present tense.
- [x] fixed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/lib/kosztorys/work-catalogue/append-catalogue-items.ts:14` · Four lines for a passthrough. Cut to the two that carry the rationale.
- [x] dismissed · `comment-noise-audit` · `src/migrations/20260902_0_collapse_kosztorys_tool_overrides.ts:5` · Flagged for describing the prior schema. In a migration the prior schema IS the subject, and the backfill warning is the most load-bearing comment in the diff.
- [x] dismissed · `feature-first-structure` · — · 0 placement violations; the migration, the restored `subcontractor-price-edit.ts`, all 31 specs and the change docs sit in their documented homes, and the datasheet-grid seam still runs one way.
- [x] dismissed · `module-cohesion-audit` · — · No cohesion violation introduced; three files improved (`subcontractor-price-edit.ts` 4→2 exports, `calc.ts` loses `overrideTypeFor`, `types.ts` loses `SubcontractorOverrideTypeT`). Two pre-existing god modules surfaced (`lib/actions/kosztorys.ts` 750 LOC, `row-conditions.ts` 602 LOC) — both only shrank here; a split is its own review.
- [x] dismissed · `structure-scatter-audit` · — · 0 scattered kinds, 0 stray colocations, 0 catch-alls. `SubcontractorOverrideTypeT`'s deletion removed a genuine three-layer contract.
- [x] dropped · `feature-first-structure` · `src/components/kosztorys/editor/grid/cells/subcontractor-columns.tsx:25` · `modeOf` (read) and `modeChange` (write) encode the `null ⇄ 'amount'` convention across two layers. `modeOf` produces a menu option string and is presentation-only, so it is the column's own contract; a move would drag domain into the cell or presentation into `lib/`.

- [x] filed · `gate-step-3` · `e2e/` · No browser spec for the auto-vs-explicit-0 distinction, which is the whole slice and is only visible in the grid and on `/k/<token>` — blocked on a staging deploy that does not exist yet, so filed EX-767 (`e2e-backlog`).
      test: no automated test · e2e — the obligation travels in EX-767; until then `manual-checks.md` covers it

## Simplify pass

Not dispatched — see the note under the fan-out. Four reuse/simplification findings surfaced by
`code-review` and `module-cohesion-audit`; three applied, one dropped.

## Tests & suite

- `pnpm typecheck` — green (and it is what proves the `as RowT` removal is real).
- `pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/lib/kosztorys src/__tests__/lib/db` — 994 passed, 71 skipped.
- `pnpm test:parity`, `pnpm test:integration`, `pnpm build` — green at `562ddbe1` / `c2cbeba8`; the
  post-review edits are comment trims plus three typed refactors that `tsc` covers. Re-run before push.
- E2E: filed as EX-767 (`e2e-backlog`) — see the last finding above.
