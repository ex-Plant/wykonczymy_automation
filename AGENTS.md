# AGENTS.md

Only what's true for THIS repo and not inferable from the framework or `@package.json`. Global conventions (style, TS/React/Next/Tailwind, git, personas) live in the user's global rules.

## Project Overview

Business management dashboard for cash registers, transfers, investments, and employees. Next.js + Payload CMS. **Polish UI, English code.** Code comments are always in English, even when the UI strings they sit next to are Polish. Versions in `@package.json`.

### Naming a financial figure

Canonical identifiers, the App↔Code translation, and the drift still to fix live in the glossary
`@context/domain/02-glossary.md` (backed by **EX-548**) — **consult it before naming a figure.** The
four rules it enforces:

1. **Polish only for sheet proper nouns.** A Polish identifier survives only as the name of a
   specific artifact in the owner's sheet with **no clean English equivalent** (`kosztorys`,
   `przedmiar`, `pomiar`). The test is the English equivalent, not "the sheet says it in Polish" —
   the sheet also says `etapy` / `robocizna`, which are `stage` / `laborCosts` in code and stay
   Polish in UI labels and prose only.
2. **Everything else is English.** A generic figure is not a sheet noun: `balance` / `margin` /
   `discount` / `deposit` / `payout` / `loss` — never `bilans` / `marza` / `rabat` / `wplaty` /
   `wyplaty` / `strata`.
3. **No half-translated identifiers.** A Polish root welded to an English affix (`robociznaNet`,
   `zaliczkiByStage`, `wplatyNet`) is banned outright — one identifier is one language, and that
   language is English.
4. **One concept, one name** — the cardinal sin is two. A figure carries the _same_ identifier in
   kosztorys as on the transfers side (`src/collections/transfers.ts`, `src/lib/db`), so nobody
   translates across the recon seam.

**Plane suffix — the only exception to rule 4.** Where a concept genuinely exists on _both_ the
kosztorys and the transactions plane and the reconciliation compares the two, keep the base name
identical and append `FromKosztorys` / `FromTransactions` — `laborCostsNetFromKosztorys` /
`laborCostsNetFromTransactions`. The shared prefix keeps the pair legible as one concept.
**Only where two planes actually collide:** a one-plane figure stays bare (`depositsByStage`), as
does an aggregate at its own source (`totalLaborCosts`). The suffix warns that a twin exists —
hang it on everything and it stops warning.

## The Owner's Reference Sheet (read this before touching kosztorys)

The kosztorys editor is a port of a live Google Sheet. **The sheet is the domain authority** — when a
question is "what does this figure mean to the business", read the sheet's formulas, don't reason from
our code. Ours is the copy; theirs is the original.

**One register per message — never mixed.** This governs **how the agent talks to the owner**, not
identifier naming — that's the `Polish UI, English code` rule above; never read this as license for
Polish code identifiers. Talk kosztorys in the sheet's names: „Przedmiar", „Pomiar
z natury", „etapy", „Cena j.m.", „rabat", „Wartość netto przedmiar". **Never** `plannedQty` /
`measuredQty` / `rowValueForView`, and never both registers in one message — not even as a
parenthetical gloss or a mapping column. Sheet names for any domain/design conversation; code
identifiers only in code review, implementation notes, and commits. The user reasons about the
business, so translating between the two is the agent's job, silently — the mapping belongs in
`context/reference/kosztorys-editor-domain-notes.md`, not in the conversation.

**Current reference** — _"Kopia aktualny arkusz 16 lipca 2026 - wersja w jakiej klient dostaje to
wstępnie"_, i.e. the state a client receives as an initial offer:

```
1kEWaMv9KRRXVaSMu3AJRw_ptxucnF4oafLR74VWeRHg    # tab kosztorys_robocizny, gid=70964819
```

Shared read-only with the service account in `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. Read it with the existing
inspector — it dumps **formulas and values side by side**, which is the whole point (a formula is
evidence, a rendered number is only a hint):

```bash
SHEET_ID=1kEWaMv9KRRXVaSMu3AJRw_ptxucnF4oafLR74VWeRHg TABS="kosztorys_robocizny" MAX_ROWS=464 \
  node --env-file=./.env scripts/inspect-sheet.mjs > /tmp/sheet.txt
```

**Filled test sheet** (better for testing than the canonical, which is a blank initial offer) —
_„wypełniony kosztorys do testów"_, real values across all figures **plus** the three v1-sync mirror
tabs (`wydatki inwestycyjne` / `transfery` / `rozliczone R+M`) baked in:

```
1qN68vcevWgq0fXckdh4cuyBJ4iGZNlivVuHDvLuzWy4    # tab kosztorys_robocizny, gid=70964819
```

Also shared read-only with the service account. Nine tabs (adds `materiały`, `pokoje`, `Podsumowanie`,
the two `zakres pracy z/bez narzędzi` catalogues). Its layout carries column `T = „komentarz"` and the
`U–AE` per-etap wartość axis (`AE` = bilans), so it's the canonical fixture for parity/import work.
**Caveat (owner):** some formulas in this test sheet are broken here and there — treat it as a rich
_shape/layout_ fixture, and cross-check any figure against the canonical sheet before trusting it as spec.

Screenshots of the client-facing offer view (which columns/rows the owner hides before sending, and
the summary block at the bottom) — the target state the app must reach:

- `context/reference/kosztorys-sheet/offer-view-rows.png` — filtered item rows
- `context/reference/kosztorys-sheet/offer-view-footer.png` — summary block + section pie chart

**Load-bearing structural facts** (verified across all 435 item rows, 2026-07-16):

- `N` **Przedmiar** is typed by hand — the offered scope. `S` = `N × cena − rabat` = **the offer**.
- `O` **Pomiar z natury** is **not typed — it is a formula**: `=SUM(D:M)`, the ten stage-quantity
  columns. So in the owner's model **pomiar IS the stage sum**, and `T` = `O × cena − rabat` is what
  has actually been executed. This is the fact EX-494 turns on.
- The footer keeps `wartość netto` (`T456`) and `R netto - suma prac wykonannych` (`T463`) as separate
  named rows — read them before assuming which figure the UI's "total" should be.

Domain background (prose, may lag the sheet — verify against it): `context/reference/kosztorys-editor-domain-notes.md`.

## Backlog & Task Tracking

- **Slices:** `context/foundation/roadmap.md` is the source of truth — the v2 arc (`F-01`, `S-01`…`S-19`) in dependency order, each with a `Status` field (`ready` / `proposed` / `blocked` / `done`). Start here for what to build next. Built from `context/foundation/prd.md` via `/10x-roadmap`; per-change plans land in `context/changes/<change-id>/` via `/10x-plan`.
- **Todos & live status:** Linear project **"Wykonczymy"** (team Ex-plant) only — the slice-status mirror plus every smaller / ad-hoc task. No second todo file. The moment you start work that has a Linear issue — any slice, task, or ad-hoc item, not just slices — flip that issue to In Progress (agents routinely forget this), and to Done when complete. **Reality-check Linear access first** — if the Linear MCP isn't connected, update the slice's `Status` in `roadmap.md` rather than claim a Linear change you can't make.
- **All prose docs live under `context/`** (`foundation/` durable, `changes/` in-flight, `archive/` done, `reference/` standalone references) — never create a top-level `docs/` dir.
- **Doc lifecycle:** a one-off design/plan doc is not current truth — verify its claims against code before trusting or quoting it. When a change ships, extract the durable rationale into the right living doc (`lessons.md` / a `foundation/` or `context/reference/` doc), then **archive** the raw doc under `context/archive/<slug>/`. Delete only pure scaffolds with zero unique rationale.
- Refactor/cleanup backlog: track in Linear; record new findings there rather than spawning a standalone audit doc.
- After ANY bigger change, plan/implementation etc. update the relevant living doc and clean up stale plans/designs per the Doc lifecycle rule above.

## Common Commands

Scripts live in `@package.json`. Non-obvious ones:

```bash
pnpm build         # generate:importmap + generate:types + next build (NO migrate — see Migrations)
pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/some-file.test.ts  # single test file — pnpm 10 no longer forwards `--` to nested scripts
pnpm generate:types  # regenerate src/payload-types.ts (gitignored — never `git add` it)
docker compose up -d  # local Postgres on port 5433
```

### Seeding kosztorys test data (local dev DB)

Two one-off scripts populate an investment's kosztorys with test rows (each wipes that
investment's kosztorys first; `INV` selects the target investment):

```bash
INV=6 node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/seed-kosztorys.ts       # realistic rozpiska from the test sheet (~40 items)
INV=7 node --env-file=.env --import tsx src/scripts/perf-seed-kosztorys.ts  # synthetic ~1000-item perf dataset
```

`seed-kosztorys.ts` reads a live Google Sheet (needs `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`), so its
shape tracks the sheet's current state. Domain background: `context/reference/kosztorys-editor-domain-notes.md`.

### Migrations

`pnpm migrate:create` has emitted phantom drift since ~March 2026 (missing `.json` snapshots), so **hand-write migrations**: copy the structure of the latest file in `src/migrations/` and adjust FK constraints / internal Payload tables by hand. Don't trust an auto-generated migration blindly.

**Migrations are NO LONGER run by the build.** `payload migrate` was removed from `pnpm build` so a Vercel deploy (incl. previews) can never touch the schema — code and schema are separate planes. Apply migrations to prod deliberately with **`pnpm db:migrate:prod`** (dumps Neon prod first, then `payload migrate` against `DB_POSTGRES_URL_PROD`), run by a **human**, never the agent. A `.husky/pre-push` gate reminds you on a push to `main` that adds `src/migrations/*.ts`. **Order follows the direction of the migration.** Additive (the new code needs a column that isn't there yet) → migrate prod **before** pushing. Destructive (a `DROP COLUMN`) → the reverse, because the column is what the _old_ code needs: push first, migrate once the new deploy is live, or every request in between hits a live SELECT naming a dropped column (Postgres 42703). This is a **deploy-time** gate, not a phase gate — writing the migration and the local code that reads the column is one continuous local task; do not stop implementation or mark a plan phase "blocked on prod" while nothing is being pushed. The prod step is owed only when the code actually ships. Pattern owned by the `payload-prod-migrate` skill.

### Dependencies

Prefer hand-editing `@package.json` over `pnpm remove` / `pnpm install`. On this arm64 machine those re-link `node_modules` and can swap the native `lightningcss` binary to x64 — dropping `lightningcss.darwin-arm64.node` and breaking the Tailwind v4 / Turbopack CSS build with an error that blames `src/styles/globals.css`. Repair: `pnpm install --force`, then `rm -rf .next` and restart dev. Detail: `context/foundation/lessons.md`.

## Databases And Live Data

- **The real DB is Neon Postgres** — `DB_POSTGRES_URL_PROD` in `.env` is the live prod credential. **Never run SQL, migrations, or dumps-restores against the Neon URL**; a human applies prod migrations.
- The local app points at the docker Postgres on 5433 (`DB_POSTGRES_URL`, db `wykonczymy-db`) — a copy restored from Neon dumps: `pnpm db:dump` (prod → `dumps/dump-latest.sql`, also run by the pre-push hook) and `pnpm db:import` (dump → local). Refreshable, but confirm before wiping it — a restore loses anything entered locally since the last dump.
- The **E2E suite** runs against an isolated `db-test` container on **5435** (`DB_POSTGRES_URL_TEST`, db `wykonczymy-test`), never the dev DB. Populate/reset its fixtures with `pnpm db:import:test` (same dump → test DB). `pnpm test:e2e` starts the container (`--wait` on its healthcheck) but does **not** import — run `db:import:test` once after a fresh volume or to reset.
- **A `db-test` reset is three commands, not one: `pnpm db:import:test` → `pnpm seed:kosztorys:test` → `pnpm seed:deposits:test`.** The prod dump carries no wpłata brutto, and `pnpm test:parity`'s dataset floor fails closed on it: without the wpłata-brutto seed the whole brutto plane and the legacy bridge (`net_amount IS NULL`, derived at VAT) are zero everywhere, so the guard would pass green having tested neither.
- **Google Sheets: two service accounts — reads everywhere, writes only from production.** The sheet
  id comes from the DB and every non-production database is a restored prod dump, so localhost,
  preview and the E2E DB all carry **live sheet ids**. That is how eight sheets took 36 foreign rows
  in 2026-08. The gate is therefore the **credential**, not a flag, because a flag is only as strong
  as the machine it runs on — and this machine holds production's secrets.
  `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (`kosztorys-sheets-reader@…`) is a **Viewer** on all 56 sheets and is
  what `.env`, Preview and Development carry; `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_WRITE_JSON`
  (`kosztorys-sheets@…`) is the **Editor** and exists **only in Vercel Production**. So a write from
  a dev machine is refused by Google (`403`), not by our code — no env var, no `VERCEL_ENV=production`
  and no code edit can undo that. `getWritableSheetsClient`
  (`src/lib/google/writable-sheets-client.ts`) is the one place **in the app** that mints a
  write-scoped **Sheets** token, and it throws a readable sentence when the credential is absent so
  you get an explanation instead of a bare 403; reads take `getReadonlySheetsClient()`, which is
  readonly by SCOPE — on production it carries the Editor account, so one share covers a sheet. The only
  other holder of the Editor credential is `scripts/share-sheets-with-reader.mjs`, which mints a
  **Drive** token — a strictly broader power, since it can change who may edit a sheet.
  Repairing a sheet happens from production, and there is no other route. The var is **optional in
  the schema everywhere but production**, where its absence fails the boot (`env/schema.ts`
  `superRefine`) — elsewhere the absence IS the gate, but on production deleting it would break no
  request and silently stop every transfer from reaching the owner's sheet.
  **A new sheet needs ONE share for production — Edytujący for the Editor account.** Production
  reads with the Editor credential too (`getReadonlySheetsClient` mints its readonly-scoped token
  from the write credential wherever that credential exists), so the reader share is what a sheet
  needs to be readable from **localhost / Preview / the E2E DB**, never from production:

  ```
  kosztorys-sheets@wykonczymy-kosztorys-bk.iam.gserviceaccount.com          → Edytujący   (produkcja)
  kosztorys-sheets-reader@wykonczymy-kosztorys-bk.iam.gserviceaccount.com   → Przeglądający (dev/preview)
  ```

  Never give the reader Editor — that would hand write rights back to every laptop for that sheet.
  `scripts/share-sheets-with-reader.mjs` does the reader half in bulk — from production, over a
  `id<TAB>name` TSV exported from psql: `node scripts/share-sheets-with-reader.mjs sheets.tsv`
  dry-runs, `--apply` grants. It skips a sheet the reader already holds, shouts if the reader was
  given anything above Viewer, and exits non-zero on any failure.

- **Poczta wychodzi tylko z produkcji — bramką jest `EMAIL_HOST`.** Poza produkcją wskazuje na
  `disabled.invalid` (zarezerwowany TLD, RFC 2606), więc wysyłka pada na DNS; prawdziwy host stoi
  zakomentowany obok w `.env` i podmienia się go ręcznie na czas pracy nad szablonami. Pusta wartość
  nie zadziała — `serverEnv` wymaga `.min(1)`. To nie jest kosmetyka: aplikacja jest **klientem**
  SMTP firmowego serwera, więc mail z localhosta wychodził z tej samej infrastruktury co produkcyjny,
  z poprawnym SPF/DKIM, do skrzynki odbiorczej. Listy odbiorców żyją w globalu Payloada
  `notification-recipients`, czyli **w bazie**, więc każdy `db:import` wsypuje prawdziwe adresy
  pracowników do każdego środowiska i `requireRecipients` nigdy nie zadziała jako ochrona.

  `context/reference/outgoing-effects-isolation.md` — **przeczytaj przed dodaniem nowej integracji
  wychodzącej.**

- **The production Vercel Blob store belongs to production only.** Invoice bytes live in Blob, which
  has no versioning and no undelete — and the local DB is a restored prod dump, so `media.filename`
  values are the real invoices. A delete on localhost against the production store therefore destroys
  a tax-retained faktura. Local dev, Vercel Development and Preview/staging all point
  `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` at the **preview** store; the GitHub Actions secret of the same name stays
  **production** (the nightly backup must keep backing up production). No script reads
  `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN_PROD` — it is parked in `.env` for deliberate opt-in, so reaching production
  means exporting it at the call site:
  `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="$BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN_PROD" node scripts/blob-snapshot.mjs --download`.
  Run a blob script off plain `.env` and you get the **preview** store — the read-only tools won't
  object, they will just snapshot the wrong store and report success. Three guards enforce the write
  side: the env layer refuses a store/environment mismatch in **either** direction — the production
  token when `VERCEL_ENV !== 'production'`, and the preview token when it **is** (that store is wiped
  and re-restored as scratch, so production invoices written there are lost) —
  (`src/lib/env/schema.ts`), `src/payload.config.ts` runs the same check where it hands the token to
  the Blob plugin (the env layer never loads in the Payload graph, so `/admin` would otherwise delete
  unguarded), and `scripts/blob-restore.mjs` refuses **any** target that is not the preview store
  without `--allow-prod`. Beware
  `.env.local` — `vercel env pull` writes there and Next.js prefers it over `.env`. The preview store
  is a point-in-time copy, so an invoice newer than the last restore 404s locally; top it up with
  `pnpm blob:refresh:preview` (needs `lftp`; caches the FTP mirror in `dumps/blob-mirror`, uploads at
  most `BLOB_REFRESH_MAX` files per run). Detail: `context/reference/blob-recovery-runbook.md` §3.
- **Dumpy starych arkuszy klientów leżą poza gitem** — `~/.local/share/wykonczymy-legacy-sheets/`
  (kopia w `dumps/legacy-sheets/`, wycięta przez `.gitignore`): 57 arkuszy + `raport.md`. Skrypty,
  które je pobrały, są skasowane i żyją tylko w historii. Mapa:
  `context/reference/legacy-sheet-dumps.md`.
- Never `git push`; a human pushes to remotes.

## Architecture

### Route Groups

- `src/app/(frontend)` — main authenticated app
- `src/app/(auth)` — login page
- `src/app/(payload)` — Payload admin panel and API routes

**Parallel-route slots.** Shell chrome that needs route params (it can't read them from the layout)
gets a `@slot` directory under `(frontend)/`. The slot's `page.tsx` is a **re-export only** — the
component itself lives in `src/components/nav/` — and the slot needs a `default.tsx` for routes that
don't match. `@investmentCrumb` (the investment name + back arrow in the top bar) is the first and
currently only instance; mirror its shape rather than inventing a second arrangement.

**Editor hooks (EX-521).** `use-kosztorys-editor.ts` at the editor root is the **composition entry**
— it wires sub-hooks together and owns the return shape components read. Each cohesive cluster it
delegates to (stage ops, settlement settings, view state, …) is one leaf hook under
`editor/hooks/`. A new cluster goes there, not into a second root-level hook, and **nothing moves
into `KosztorysEditorProvider`** — context value-identity churn is the EX-496 perf regression that
was reverted once already. Logic that is genuinely React-free belongs one layer further out in
`src/lib/kosztorys/`, where it is testable without a hook renderer; that split is why this codebase
has never needed `renderHook`.

### Important Directories

Most are self-describing (`src/collections`, `src/access`, `src/stores`, …). The non-obvious ones:

- `src/lib/db` — the raw-SQL **data-access** layer: a statement plus its row mapper, nothing else. Auth,
  caching and view-shaping belong one layer up in `src/lib/queries`, and mutations in `src/lib/actions`.
  It started as financial calculations only and is now much wider (`get-db`, `where-to-sql`,
  `with-payload-transaction`, `snapshots`, `presets`, `notifications`, `kosztorys-tree`) — read the rule,
  not the original theme, when deciding whether a new file lands here.
  A **read** a client component invokes on demand is a `'use server'` function in `src/lib/queries`
  (`register-saldo.ts`, `subcontractor-roster.ts`) — never in `src/lib/actions`, which is mutations only.
- `src/lib/cache` — cache tags + revalidation helpers
- Per-feature schemas/hooks live under `src/components/forms/<form>/`, not in `src/types` (which is cross-feature only).
  **A hook's home follows its consumer count, not its subject:** one form → `forms/<form>/`; two or
  more forms → `forms/hooks/`; a non-form surface → `src/hooks/`. That is why the three file-ingest
  hooks sit in three directories (`expense-form/use-invoice-files.ts`, `forms/hooks/use-file-pick-ingest.ts`,
  `hooks/use-invoice-upload.ts`) — one rule, not three accidents. `forms/hooks/` therefore means
  "shared by 2+ forms", not "domain-free form plumbing"; a domain-aware hook belongs there too once a
  second form uses it.
  The counting is over **directories, not files**: three cells in one directory sharing a hook is
  still one consumer, so `useCellDraft` stays colocated in `editor/grid/cells/` while
  `useInlineRename` — read from two directories — sits in `editor/hooks/`. Promote a hook when a second
  directory reaches for it, not when a third file in the same one does.
- `src/components/ui` is the domain-agnostic primitives layer — a component that knows it is filtering
  a list belongs in `src/components/filters/` (EX-730 moved the last four out of `ui/`; git history and
  older imports still point at the old home, so don't take a precedent from there)
- **The datasheet-grid seam runs one way.** `src/components/ui/datasheet-grid/` holds the presentational
  primitives a cell renders (`EditableCellInput`, `ReadOnlyCellText`, `CellSelectMenu`); the `Column`
  factories that know what a figure MEANS live in `src/components/kosztorys/editor/grid/cells/`. A
  factory imports a primitive, never the reverse — that is why `decimalColumn` sits under `kosztorys/`
  despite looking generic: it is parameterised by a `CellEditPolicyT`, which is domain.

## Auth And Roles

JWT auth via Payload using the `payload-token` cookie (7-day lifetime). Roles: `ADMIN`, `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`. Hierarchy in `src/lib/auth/roles.ts`; access control functions in `src/access`.

## Mutation Pattern

All mutations go through `protectedAction()` in `src/lib/actions`:

- `'use server'`
- `requireAuth()`
- perf logging via `perfStart()`
- return `ActionResultT`
- trigger cache revalidation where needed

## Data Fetching And Cache

- Financial calculations use raw SQL via `@vercel/postgres` (in `src/lib/db`), not the Payload ORM.
- Cache uses `unstable_cache` with tag-based invalidation; `cacheComponents` and `'use cache'` are disabled due to a Vercel bug.
- Revalidation differs by context: in **server actions** (`lib/actions`, `lib/cache/revalidate.ts`) use `updateTag()` for immediate expiration; in **Payload hooks** (`hooks/`) use `revalidateTag()` — hooks run in a Route Handler context where `updateTag` throws. Never import `lib/cache/revalidate.ts` from a Payload hook.

## Forms

- TanStack React Form via the custom `useAppForm()` hook (not React Hook Form)
- Optimistic updates use `useOptimisticFormStore` (Zustand), fire-and-forget

## Transfer Business Logic

The transfer-type union lives in `src/collections/transfers.ts` — read it there rather than trusting a copy (this list has gone stale before).

Non-obvious rules:

- `LABOR_COST` (robocizna) has **no source register** — it is a billing/markup figure, not a cash movement. It feeds the margin (`marża = robocizna − wypłaty − rabat − strata`), not the cash ledger.
- `CORRECTION` may be negative (invoice credits).
- `RABAT` (rabat) is a labour discount: **no source register**, positive amount, requires an investment. It hits **both** figures — lowers `marża` and raises `bilans` (the client owes less) — unlike `CORRECTION`, which moves only the balance.
- `LOSS` (strata) is a company-absorbed cost: **no source register**, positive amount, investment **required** (EX-675). Like `RABAT` it hits **both** figures — lowers `marża` and raises `bilans` (the client stops owing what the company swallowed). The two differ on the brutto plane: a rabat is a concession on the _price_, so it grosses by VAT, while a strata deducts at **face value** on netto and brutto alike and never widens the VAT base.
- Cancellation is an audit trail: the original is marked `cancelled: true`, a new `CANCELLATION` row links back to it.
- Cash register balances are **not** stored — they are computed on read by cached functions. The transfer hooks (`hooks/transfers/recalculate-balances.ts`) only revalidate cache tags; nothing is written back.

**`LABOR_COST` and `RABAT` are bookable again, temporarily (EX-649, reversing EX-555 — EX-712 closes it).** EX-555 took both out of the transfer dialog because robocizna and rabat come from the **kosztorys**. That holds only once an investment's kosztorys is IN the app: while it is still a spreadsheet the reading returns 0 zł and, with the dialog also refusing the booking, the investment could be settled by no route at all. So both are offered again for **every** investment, with no gating — double-counting is made **visible** rather than prevented, by the „Robocizna v1 / v2" columns on the investments listing and by the v2 reconciliation. **EX-712 removes both entries, and those columns, once the rozjazd between the two is zero everywhere.** Everything else about the two types was never touched: the enum, existing rows, history, filters, cancellation and sheet sync.

**There is no fallback, and no figure declares its source.** No kosztorys means robocizna 0 zł and rabat 0 zł on v2 and on the listing — an empty kosztorys is an answer, not a question forwarded to the transfers. The listing RENDERS that zero as „brak danych" on its v2 columns (`components/tables/investments.tsx`), because a v2 bilans built on it reads as „the client owes nothing for work that was done"; the figure underneath is still zero and still never consults the transfers. **v1 vs v2 IS the source choice**: v1 renders the transactions plane and is where legacy robocizna booked as `LABOR_COST`/`RABAT` stays readable until someone enters that work into the kosztorys. So v1 and the listing legitimately disagree for such an investment — that gap is the to-do list, not a defect, and it is not backfilled. On the investment page the reconciliation says the same thing out loud: an empty kosztorys against booked transfers screams a mismatch until the work is entered.

How the financial figures (marża / materiały / robocizna / korekty) connect: `context/foundation/investment-financials-and-discount.md`.

## Testing

Two test homes by layer: **unit** → Vitest specs under `src/__tests__` (aliases `@/*` → `./src/*`); single-file command in **Common Commands**. **Browser E2E** → Playwright specs under `e2e/` (`pnpm test:e2e`), against the isolated 5435 `db-test` container — see the harness in `context/changes/e2e-harness/`.

**Vitest specs live under `src/__tests__`, never colocated next to their source** — this is the
one place the feature-first rule is deliberately overridden, because `scripts/test-integration.sh`
discovers the DB-backed specs by grepping that tree. A colocated spec is simply never run by the
pre-push gate. Inside it, mirror the source path **in full, every intermediate directory included** —
`src/lib/db/x.ts` → `src/__tests__/lib/db/x.test.ts`, and a deep component path keeps its depth:
`src/components/kosztorys/editor/dialogs/preset-picker-groups.ts` →
`src/__tests__/components/kosztorys/editor/dialogs/preset-picker-groups.test.ts`. Never file a spec
under the mirror of a directory that isn't its source — a spec for a `components/**` module goes under
`__tests__/components/**` even when its subject is kosztorys logic. Several specs may share one source
file; they differ by filename, not by folder. The top level holds older specs that predate the
mirroring and cross-cutting ones. A spec that
asserts the whole dataset against a committed fixture (the golden master) is excluded from that
discovery on purpose and runs via `pnpm test:parity` instead — its neighbours create rows in the
same shared DB.

Don't hand-roll tests or pick the layer by feel — route to a skill. Always start from a risk in test-plan.md, never from "cover this file"; the cheapest layer that gives a real signal wins. The trap behind every bad test — assert observable behavior, not the implementation under test — and the full anti-pattern lists are owned by the skills (/10x-tdd, /10x-e2e's references/) and test-plan.md; don't restate them here.

- **New code, test-first** → **`/10x-tdd`** (when you can name the first failing test in one sentence and the impl isn't written yet).
- **Protecting existing code** → `/10x-research` → `/10x-plan` → `/10x-implement`, anchored on the risk.
- **Browser-level / multi-boundary risk** → **`/10x-e2e`** — Playwright harness lives in `e2e/` (`pnpm test:e2e`, isolated 5435 `db-test`); add browser specs there. A browser-level slice **owes** its E2E: author it at the review gate, or defer it into the **E2E backlog** — a Linear issue labelled `e2e-backlog` in project "Wykonczymy" (`slice-review-gate` Step 3 blocks archive until the E2E box is authored or filed with that issue id). "Deferred to `/10x-e2e`" in a commit message does **not** discharge it.
- **A bug that slipped past the tests (test-driven debugging) — mandatory, not optional.** Reproduce it with a **failing test first**, then fix — never silently patch. Assert the **persisted / observable state, not the action's return value** — a success result can hide a failed write. The repro test stays as the regression guard for the path that had none.

`context/foundation/test-plan.md` exists — anchor new tests on a risk it names rather than on "cover this file". For a risk it doesn't cover yet, extend it with `/10x-test-plan` before writing the tests.

## Tech Debt

Non-blocking refactor/cleanup findings live in Linear, in the same **"Wykonczymy"** project as everything else — there is no separate tech-debt project (an earlier "Wykonczymy v2" was never created, and two review gates have now filed into the void looking for it). Check it before starting a refactor, and record new findings there rather than spawning a standalone audit doc.

## Stack Notes

- **The Vercel account is on a PAID plan.** Hobby's limits do not apply — neither "2 cron jobs, once
  a day" (`vercel.json` declares three and all of them run) nor the 2K/month Blob advanced-operations
  allowance. Don't shrink a design to fit a cap that isn't there: a new scheduled job is a new
  `vercel.json` entry, not a second stream bolted onto another feature's handler.
  `context/reference/blob-recovery-runbook.md` documents a Hobby-era incident and reads like current state.
- React Compiler is enabled — don't hand-write `useMemo` / `useCallback` for things it handles
- **The breakpoint scale is overridden** in `src/styles/globals.css` — `sm`=768px, `md`=1024px, `lg`=1280px, where Tailwind ships 640/768/1024. `sm:` is this app's single mobile→desktop break; `md:` is a second, tablet-large step used almost only by the marketing pages. Any snippet pasted from shadcn/upstream docs assumes the stock scale and fires one step too late. **Re-map it onto this scale by intent, not by tier name (EX-624):** an upstream `sm:` and an upstream `md:` are both mobile→desktop splits here, so both become `sm:`. Never add a 640 breakpoint to reproduce upstream's — this app has one mobile→desktop line and it is 768.
- `src/app/(payload)/layout.tsx` must include `importMap`, `serverFunction`, and `handleServerFunctions`
- A `console.error` that must become a Sentry capture once Sentry is wired gets a `// TODO(EX-449) SENTRY-REQUIRED:` marker (greppable + shows in the IDE TODO panel) — never a bare comment

## Environment Variables

Read env **only** through the validated layer in `src/lib/env/` — never raw `process.env` (an ESLint
`no-restricted-syntax` rule enforces it; `NODE_ENV` is the lone exception). Schemas live in
`env/schema.ts`; client entry is `env` (`env/index.ts`, `FRONTEND_URL`), server entry `env/server.ts` (`serverEnv`).

Traps:

- `env/server.ts` is `server-only` — **never import it from the Payload CLI graph** (`payload.config.ts`
  / collections), where `server-only` throws under `payload generate:types`. That's why
  `payload.config.ts` is the one file allowlisted to read raw `process.env`.
- `(frontend)/layout.tsx` imports both entries as the build gate (a missing var fails `next build`) —
  don't delete those seemingly-unused imports.
- Tests alias both entries to passthrough stubs (`src/__tests__/stubs/`); the eager parse otherwise
  forces every server-touching test to supply the whole env.
