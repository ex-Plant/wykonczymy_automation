# plain `pnpm vitest run` in pre-push skips every one of them for lack of a DB; this
# is the leg that actually wires a DB and exercises the wipe-and-reinsert restore path.
#
# Middle path on cost: the specs SELF-PROVISION their fixtures (each beforeAll creates
# its own investment), so they need a schema-current DB, not fresh prod CONTENT. We
# therefore re-import the prod dump only when it can matter — the migrations changed or
# the test DB is empty — and otherwise just migrate (idempotent) and run. A full psql
# restore on every push would copy rows no test ever reads.
