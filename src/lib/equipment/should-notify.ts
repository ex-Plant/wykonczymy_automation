 * The bucket this item earns in today's digest, or `null` for silence. Decides only — the caller

 * One axis, unlike the fleet's two: a warranty has a date and nothing else to measure. And no
 * re-nag branch, because the fleet's weekly repeat exists for a deadline you can still catch up on;
 * a lapsed warranty is simply gone, so repeating it would be noise nobody can act on.
