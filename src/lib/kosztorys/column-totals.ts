/**
 * Every column's total over a set of rows, keyed by the grid's own column ids — the shape both the
 * „Razem" row and each section's footer render from.
 *
 * One function for both, because they are the same figure at two scopes: the footer is this over one
 * section's rows, „Razem" is this over all of them. Σ of the footers therefore equals „Razem" by
 * construction rather than by two implementations happening to agree.
 *
 * A column absent from the map renders blank. That is the honest outcome for a column whose total is
 * not a sum of its own cells (a share, a ratio) — never a 0, which would claim a reading.
 *
 * The quantity columns („Przedmiar", „Pomiar (razem etapy)", each etap's ilość) are absent for that
 * reason: rows in one section carry different jednostki miary, so 40 m² + 12 mb + 3 szt. adds to 55
 * of nothing. Only the zł columns share a unit across rows and may be summed. Per row those columns
 * still total fine — one row is one jednostka — which is why the columns themselves stay.
 *
 * `net` is the executed value BEFORE any rabat globalny, matching what the „Razem" row has always
 * shown: the global rabat is a single subtraction the summary panel makes once, not a per-row figure
 * these columns could carry a share of.
