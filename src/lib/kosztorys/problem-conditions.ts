/**
 * The one definition of what counts as a problem — the menu, the exclusive pick, the row latch and
 * the stage narrowing all read it, so they cannot answer „co jest tu zepsute" four different ways.
 *
 * Both registries feed one list. They stay separate registries because pozycje and etapy are different
 * subjects, but to the reader they are one question, distinguished only by the noun each row names.
 *
 * Order: pozycje, then etapy, then the problems that read as a whole sentence. The sentence ones are
 * a statement about the INVESTMENT rather than one more thing to look at, they wrap over three lines,
 * and they light up in bulk — put among the terse rows they push the short problems off the bottom of
 * the list, so they sit last.
 *
 * Here rather than beside the menu that renders it: nothing about this is React, and the editor's own
 * composition root reads it too — importing it up out of a leaf toolbar folder inverted the layering.
