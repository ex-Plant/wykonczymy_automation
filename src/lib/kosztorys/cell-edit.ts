 * ones roll the row back to what it held on entry and owe the user a word.
 *

 * lives out here and `useCellDraft` stays a thin lifecycle around it.
 *
 * A policy is the whole difference between a plain number field, the rabat pair and a guarded
 * subcontractor price — the rules below are the same for all three.

 * committed prefix — only garbage that changed nothing goes without a word, the way every text
