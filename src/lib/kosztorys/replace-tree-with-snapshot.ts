// The investment's own editor-settings (VAT, coefficients) are not taken from `tree` by default:
// they are per-job pricing config, and a preset built for one job must not carry its config onto

//
// `takeSettingsFromTree` is the sheet import's exception, and it is load-bearing rather than a
// convenience: the import reads the markup out of the cennik's own formulas and, on the strength of
// that, hands every praca running at exactly that markup to the global coefficient („auto") instead
// of stamping it with a per-row multiplier. Drop the settings and those prace silently reprice at
// whatever the investment happened to hold — 0,55 against the sheet's 0,5525 is 151 stawki wrong by
// half a percent, each of them looking perfectly deliberate. `buildImportPlan` already merges VAT
// and any coefficient the sheet had no opinion about from the live investment, so what arrives here
// is the sheet's answer where it has one and the job's own everywhere else.
