 * The etap axis: per-stage column totals across all rows at the active view's price (the sheet's
 * filled r396/r397). The suma transzy: how much each etap has executed, in value and in quantity.
 * Every stage in `stages` gets an entry in both maps (0 when no row touched it).
 *
 * Uses the same `stageValueForView` primitive the grid's per-stage cells show — each stage's value
 * is its qty share of the row's executed net — so Σ over the stages equals the row's executed value,
 * and Σ over all stages equals the executed total (the 'amount'-rabat reconciliation the sheet's
 * V–AE block exists for holds here by construction).
 *
 * The two axes ship together because the value is DERIVED from the quantity: this loop already reads
 * every `qtyInStage` to compute the share, so summing it costs nothing, whereas a caller wanting the
 * qty axis on its own has to walk the rows once per stage (EX-612).
