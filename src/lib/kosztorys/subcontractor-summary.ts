// Why a row's „Pozostało" is red. The first three are `remaining < 0`, but they mean different things
// and a reader who can't tell them apart reads a data-entry gap as a debt:
// - `overpaid` — real work is assigned, and more has been paid out than earned.
// - `no_stages` — nobody assigned this person any etap, so their należne is 0 by omission. The
//   wypłata is probably fine; the assignment is missing.
// - `no_executed_work` — etapy ARE assigned but nothing has been executed on them yet (or they are
//   still plane-less, which credits nobody). A prepayment, not an overpayment.
// - `unattributed` — the null bucket, which is not a person. The other three are all sentences ABOUT
//   somebody, so attaching any of them to a residual states something untrue; this one exists so the
//   row can be rendered without a person-shaped qualifier.

/**
 * Pure block figures for „Podsumowanie podwykonawców", per person since EX-613: `byWorker` attributes
 * the executed work, so a row's `remaining` is what THIS worker is still owed rather than a share of
 * an investment-level lump.
 *
 * The row set is the UNION of both sides — a worker with assigned etapy and no wypłaty yet is exactly
 * the person the owner needs to see, and they exist only in `byWorker`. Etapy nobody is assigned to
 * land in the same `null` bucket as wypłaty with no worker: one unattributed residual row, never
 * spread across the named workers (spreading it would invent a debt the owner never recorded).
 *
 * The headline totals stay investment-level and are NOT Σ rows: `dueNet` is passed in from the
 * settlement's `combined` so the headline can't drift from the split even mid-edit.
