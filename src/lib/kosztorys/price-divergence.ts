/**
 * Ids of the pozycje where the SAME praca is priced differently somewhere else in the kosztorys.
 *
 * A question about a GROUP, which no `matches(row, ctx)` can answer — so it is computed once, one
 * pass above the registry, and handed in as a fact the way `hasSettledMaterial` is.
 *
 * Grouped by `catalogueKey`, the katalog's own identity for a praca: it drops the sekcja (the
 * owner's rozjazd runs Łazienka ↔ Kuchnia, so grouping per sekcja would never see it) and folds the
 * j.m. spellings (`m²` = `m2`), while keeping the same opis at a different j.m. as a genuinely
 * different price.
 *
 * Two pozycje are left out of every group. One with no cena j.m. has two diagnostics of its own, and
 * the registry keeps its counts disjoint. One with no opis is not „the same praca" as another empty
 * one — `foldDescription('')` would weld them together.
 *
 * The whole group is returned, not the odd one out: nothing here knows which price is the right one,
 * and picking the majority would be the katalog's silent rule that this diagnostic exists to expose.
