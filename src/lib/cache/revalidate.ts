 * `deferRefresh` picks which of `updateTag`'s two effects the caller wants. Both expire the tag;
 * `updateTag` additionally re-renders the calling route and streams it back in the action response,
 * while `revalidateTag` leaves the current route alone and only affects the next request for it.
 *
 * Default (`updateTag`) is right whenever the caller's own UI reads a cached value it just changed.
 * Pass `deferRefresh` when the only readers of these tags are OTHER routes — the re-render is then
 * pure cost, and on a debounced per-cell autosave it is paid on every keystroke burst.
