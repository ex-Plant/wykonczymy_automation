 * They keep separate bookkeeping columns so neither can silence the other.
 *
 * The kilometre leg is **edge-triggered, not polled**: the current mileage is unknown between
 * inspections, so it can only be judged when a new reading arrives — which happens whenever any
 * inspection is recorded, one to three times a year. That makes the km alarm late but honest, and it
 * is why "the cron didn't warn me about the oil" is not a bug.
