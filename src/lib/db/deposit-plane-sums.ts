/**
 * The wpłaty of EVERY investment, bucketed by VAT plane — the listing's twin of the panel's
 * `bucketDepositsByPlane`, summed in SQL because the listing has no business shipping every wpłata
 * row to compute four scalars. Untagged counts as netto, the same „brak wartości = netto" rule
 * (owner, 2026-07-23) the TS bucketing applies; `IS DISTINCT FROM` is what carries the null.
 *
 * Raw sums only: nothing is crossed here. A wpłata brutto carries its own netto (`net_amount`), and
 * the pre-spike rows that lack one are separated into their own bucket so the legacy bridge stays in
 * ONE place — `depositPairFromPlaneSums`, which both sides call.
 *
 * `INVESTOR_DEPOSIT` only, matching `getDepositTransactions` rather than the `income` financial
 * bucket: COMPANY_FUNDING is the company financing its own investment and must never pay down what
 * the client owes. That is a deliberate narrowing of the v1 bilans, whose `totalIncome` still counts
 * all three deposit types — v2 settles the client, v1 reads the cash ledger.
 *
 * The netto bucket is counted as well as summed: in tryb brutto those wpłaty pay nothing down, and
 * the listing has to say how many were dropped (EX-724) with no row in reach to count.
 *
 * An investment with no wpłaty is simply absent, which the caller reads as zero on both planes.
