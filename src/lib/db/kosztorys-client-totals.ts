// The client-view pair for EVERY investment at once, folded in Postgres — one row per investment,
// never one per kosztorys item.
//
// Why the aggregate rather than reading the rows and running the TS formula (the shape
// `selectKosztorysTreeData` uses for a single investment): the listing needs two scalars per
// investment, and shipping the rows to get them does not scale. Measured on a synthetic
// 1000-investment dataset (300 items × 3 etapy each): the rows are 10 MB at 200 investments and
// 49 MB at 1000, crossing the wire on every cache miss to produce 2000 numbers. Round-trip count is
// the Neon cost driver (see kosztorys-tree.ts) — that argues for one query, not for an unbounded
// payload inside it.
//
// The cost this buys is that the client-view formula now exists twice, here and in TS. TS is the
// reference implementation; this is the copy, pinned against it by a DB-backed parity spec
// (__tests__/lib/db/kosztorys-client-totals.test.ts). `lessons.md`'s two-planes-both-green drift is
// exactly the failure mode that spec exists to make impossible.
//
// The formula collapses this far because on the path to these two figures the client view neither
// filters nor rounds: `stagesForView(stages, 'client')` returns every etap (settlement-view.ts), and
// `clientTotalsFromSubtotals` reads only `net` and `discount` — the rounded fields of
// `sectionSubtotalsForView` (share, completionRatio) belong to other consumers.
