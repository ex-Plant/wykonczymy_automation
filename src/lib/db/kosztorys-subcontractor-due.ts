// What the crew is owed, for EVERY investment at once — one row per investment, never one per etap.
//
// Same trade as `kosztorys-client-totals.ts`, for the same reason: the listing needs one scalar and a
// flag per investment, and shipping the rows to compute them does not scale (49 MB at 1000
// investments). The cost is that the settlement formula now exists twice. `subcontractor-due.ts` is
// the reference implementation; this is the copy, pinned against it by a DB-backed parity spec
// (__tests__/lib/db/kosztorys-subcontractor-due.test.ts) — the two-planes-both-green drift
// `lessons.md` records is exactly what that spec exists to make impossible.
//
// Rabat is absent by construction and must stay absent: a rabat is a client concession the crew is
// still owed past, so no discount column appears anywhere below.
