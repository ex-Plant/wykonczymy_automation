 * Delete media that ended up attached to nothing. The add form uploads every page before it creates

 * them — unreachable and unbilled-for forever.
 *
 * The ids come from the client, so nothing here may take them at their word: `deleteUnreferencedMedia`
 * re-checks each one against the join table and skips anything still attached. Without that, this
 * exported action is an endpoint that erases any invoice page in the database by id.
