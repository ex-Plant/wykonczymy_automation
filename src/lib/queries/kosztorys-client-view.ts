 * The one answer to "how is investment N configured for its client": its own row, else the firm-wide

 * preview entrances take the resolved single variant from `getClientViewSettings` below, so the
 * dialog can never show a starting state the client does not get.
 *
 * Deliberately uncached and outside `cachedPreviewKosztorysEditorData`: two indexed reads mean a
 * save is live on the next request with no cache tag, and changing the firm-wide default does not
 * invalidate every investment's tree payload. `overrideAccess` because the token entrance has no
 * session at all — exactly like the token lookup beside it.
 *
 * Both reads are issued at once. Until an investment saves its own row — the common state — the
 * fallback is the answer, so awaiting the row first would put every such request through two
 * round-trip depths to reach it; the wasted global read when a row does exist is one row of a
 * single-row table.
