 * Pull the most recent leads from every form and insert any the DB is missing.
 * Reconciles against Meta directly, so it recovers leads dropped by an expired
 * token, an outage, or a mis-pointed webhook (see lessons.md — the webhook's
 * failure mode is silent).
 *
 * Backfill is silent to the CUSTOMER, never to sales. It goes through `captureLead`
 * with `autoReply: 'skip'`, so a lead recovered days late gets no „Dziękujemy za
 * kontakt" but does reach the sales inbox like any other lead. The sweep writes no
 * statuses itself: it cannot know whether sales was told, so it has no business
 * recording that decision (EX-660 — it used to stamp `notifyStatus: 'skipped'`, which
 * is terminal, and silently buried every lead the webhook had dropped).
 *
 * Deliberately free of auth and cache revalidation: the server action and the cron
 * route each supply their own. `updateTag` throws in a Route Handler, so a
 * revalidation baked in here would break one of the two callers at runtime.
 *
 * Partial failure is reported, not thrown: one form's rate-limit must not discard
 * the leads already recovered from earlier forms, nor skip the forms after it —
 * form order is stable, so a throw here would mean the tail is never swept on any
 * day. Only a failure to list the forms at all throws.
