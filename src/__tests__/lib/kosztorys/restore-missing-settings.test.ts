// `settings` reached the payload later than the payload itself, so a snapshot captured before it has
// no such key. The wipe runs BEFORE the settings write, so dereferencing the absent key would throw a
// TypeError with the live tree already deleted — the transaction rolls back and that row becomes
// permanently unrestorable. A year of retention is what makes such a row reachable at all.
//
// Two things are asserted, both on persisted state: the tree came back, and the investment's CURRENT
// coefficients were left alone rather than zeroed — a payload that says nothing about the settings is
// not a payload asking for them to be reset.
