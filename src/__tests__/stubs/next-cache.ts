// `unstable_cache` needs a request scope node lacks, and `updateTag` throws outside a server
// action, so every spec that touches cached code has to stub this module. Aliased globally in
// vitest.config.ts rather than re-mocked per spec: five hand-rolled variants of this factory had
// already drifted apart across 28 files (EX-630).
//
// The tag helpers are spies so a spec can assert on them — import them from here, not from
// 'next/cache', and clear them in beforeEach (the module is a singleton per spec file).
