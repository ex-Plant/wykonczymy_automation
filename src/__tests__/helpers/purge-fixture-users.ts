 * These specs create users with fixed emails and delete them in `afterAll`, which works
 * right up until something throws in between — then the rows survive, `email` is unique,
 * and every later run dies in `beforeAll` with Payload's `ValidationError: The following
 * field is invalid: email`. That message names neither the duplicate nor the collision, so
 * the wedge reads like a code bug and stays wedged until someone deletes rows by hand.
 *
 * Cleanup that runs on ENTRY is what makes a shared-DB spec restartable: `afterAll` only
 * runs when the run got that far, and the run that didn't is exactly the one that left the
 * mess. Registers go first — `cash_registers.owner_id` is NOT NULL, so Postgres cannot
 * null it out on the user delete and refuses the whole statement instead.
