/**
 * File custody for the pick surfaces that carry one invoice's pages OUTSIDE the form value. Files
 * stay out of the value because they are unserialisable — a persisted draft would either drop them
 * silently or refuse to rehydrate.
 *
 * What is held here is already ingested — HEIC decoded, compressed, oversize rejected — so the
 * submit path only ever uploads files Blob will accept. `isIngesting` is what a caller does NOT get
 * to ignore: a file still converting is not in `files` yet, so submitting mid-ingest would save the
 * row without its attachment. Disable submit on it AND re-check it in the action, because a keyboard
 * Enter bypasses the button.
 *
 * `inputKey` is the second thing a caller cannot ignore: put it on the `FileInput`'s `key`. The
 * picker shows the names it was handed, not the ones that survived, so after a rejected file it
 * would otherwise keep advertising an attachment that is not in `files` — the same "you think it
 * attached and it didn't" failure this hook exists to end, one layer up at the display. Everything
 * else the picker needs is `fileInputProps`, spread onto it: the pick handler and the mid-ingest
 * disable travel together so neither call site can wire up half the contract.
