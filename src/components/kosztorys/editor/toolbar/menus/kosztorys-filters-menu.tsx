// One menu for „co widzę", at three granularities that all read the same way: a tick means the thing
// is on screen, unticking it takes it away. Pozycje are hidden outright; sekcje fold under their band
// (which stays visible, with its total). Same question at three levels, so splitting them across
// separate triggers would make the user check three times.
//
// Every condition comes as a complementary pair („bez przedmiaru" / „z przedmiarem"), which is what
// makes the picker grammar work: „pokaż mi tylko te z przedmiarem" is unticking the other half, not a
// separate mode. It also means a new axis is two registry entries and nothing else.
//
// The section half reuses the transfers FilterMultiSelect, whose URL encoding is
// [] = all / [FILTER_NONE] = none / [ids] = those — bridged here to collapsedSectionIds.

  // Two gates on top of `kind === 'filter'`, both asking the same thing: is the axis on screen at all?
  //  • plane — a condition about a stawka wykonawcy is unanswerable from „Inwestor", where no
  //    subcontractor price renders. Offering it there would narrow the grid on a number the reader
  //    cannot see, and unlike a problem a filter deliberately does not switch the view to fetch it.
  //  • rabat — under a global rabat the per-item rabat applies to nothing and its columns are pulled
  //    from the grid, so the pair goes dead in the registry too; listing it would offer a tick that
  //    provably changes nothing.
  // An ENGAGED condition is listed regardless of both gates: it is hiding pozycje right now, and this
  // menu is where a tick comes back. Gating it out would leave the grid short with no control to
  // restore it — switching the view would strand a rate filter, and turning the global rabat on would
  // strand a rabat one.
