 * The editing lifecycle every numeric cell in the grid shares — the React half of `cell-edit.ts`,
 * kept as thin as it can be because this repo has no hook renderer and nothing in here is testable.
 *
 * The trap it exists for: keystrokes commit as they go, so a value the policy refuses leaves the
 * last accepted PREFIX standing on the row. Typing „12,5" is the everyday version — the comma
 * commits „12", and a cell bound straight to the row re-renders over the separator the user just
 * typed, so the „5" lands on „12" and the row stores 125. So the text is held as a draft while the
 * caret is in the cell, and leaving settles it: accepted values stay, refused ones roll the row back
 * to what it was on entry and say so out loud.
