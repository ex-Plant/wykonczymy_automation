// asks the server for the fresh tree, then we remount ONLY once that prop actually lands — keyed on a
// freshness token the caller builds, rather than on the `tree` prop's object identity (router.refresh
// reshapes that on every refresh, so a restore returning an identical-content tree would never fire an
// identity compare, leaving the latch stuck). `restorePending` gates it so the routine totals-refresh an
// ordinary edit triggers doesn't remount. No useEffect: this render-phase compare is flash-free.
//
// Latching, rather than remounting straight from the caller's `await`, is what makes the reseed correct:
// the router applies a fresh tree in a transition whose commit nothing can await, so a remount dispatched
// from an action's continuation renders first — reseeding the body from the tree it already holds.
