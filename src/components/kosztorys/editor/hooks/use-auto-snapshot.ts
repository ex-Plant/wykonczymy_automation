// Fire-and-forget periodic auto snapshot while the editor is mounted; a failed snapshot must never
// disrupt editing. `revisionRef` carries the live undo-stack revision (the interval closure captures
// values at setup, so it can't read a render-fresh value directly). A tick snapshots only when that
// revision moved since the last one — an untouched editor writes nothing.
//
// The revision lags a live edit by up to the ≤700ms undo-coalescing window (the burst buffer lives in
// use-kosztorys-editor.ts, outside the stack), so a tick landing inside a burst reads "clean" and skips.
// Harmless, and deliberately not designed around (EX-701): the marker below only advances when a
// snapshot is actually taken, so the next tick catches up, and the edit itself was persisted by the
// autosave, which never goes through the undo stack. Worst case is one snapshot delayed by an interval.
