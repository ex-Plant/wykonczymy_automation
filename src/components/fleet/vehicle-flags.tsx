/**
 * The only place marks are edited. Ticking is optimistic — the boxes are the whole UI, so waiting on
 * the round-trip would make every click feel broken.
 *
 * `useOptimistic` rather than `useState`, because the server's set moves on its own: recording an
 * inspection from this same page retires the matching mark, and a component seeded once would keep
 * showing the tick while the badge is already gone — then re-stamp that type on the next unrelated
 * toggle. Anchoring on the prop also makes the failure path free: the tick reverts to whatever the
 * server last said, with no pre-toggle snapshot to keep.
