 * A named thing with a way to take it off — one active filter, one collapsed-sections group, one
 * search phrase.
 *
 * Only the X removes, never the chip body: a chip sits next to text people read and lean on to read
 * it, and a whole-chip click target turns „which filter was that again" into an accidental undo.
 *
 * Sized off the `badge` scale so it reads as a peer of the pills already on screen rather than a
 * second, larger vocabulary of rounded things.
