 * Narrow a `transactions` probe to rows that still mean something.
 *
 * A cancelled transaction is read by no figure — every sum in `lib/db` filters `cancelled IS NOT
 * TRUE` — so orphaning one moves no money. Nor does it erase the audit trail: the dashboard's
 * transaction list is scoped to nothing, so `?cancelledTransactionAudit=1` still reaches the row,
 * and its CANCELLATION stays paired through `cancelledTransaction`, which names no investment,
 * kasa or person. What the row loses is a pointer to a record being deleted anyway.
 *
 * `not_equals` compiles to `IS NULL OR <> true` (Payload's drizzle adapter), so the nullable
 * `cancelled` column cannot let a live row slip past unblocked.
 *
 * Only for `transactions` — no other probed collection has the column.
